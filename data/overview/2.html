    <p>
        <font size=16 color=#6F2C91><b>Skills</b></font><br><br>
        The Skills sections of the CD-ROM provide you with the opportunity to review and master specific language skills for each section of the test&#8212;Reading, Listening, Speaking, and Writing.<br><br>
        The Skills exercises are not timed. You can take your time and think about your answers. You can check each answer choice and see an explanation of the correct answer before going to the next question.<br><br>
        At the top of each Skills question screen, you will find the name of the skill you are practicing&nbsp;<img src='$IMAGE/1.gif' border=0>.<br><br>
        Use the buttons at the top of the Skills Practice screens to check your answer&nbsp;<img src='$IMAGE/2.gif' border=0> and to see an explanation of the correct answer&nbsp;<img src='$IMAGE/3.gif' border=0>. In Listening and Writing and in the Speaking Integrated tasks, you can listen&nbsp;<img src='$IMAGE/4.gif' border=0> to the passage again and view the script&nbsp;<img src='$IMAGE/5.gif' border=0> of the passage.

    <p>
        At the end of each exercise, you will move to a Summary screen. This screen tells you how many questions you answered correctly, incorrectly, or did not try to answer. The complete <b>Results Report</b> shows you which questions were correct, incorrect, or not answered. You can click on questions that you want to review further.<br><br><br>
        <font size=16 color=#6F2C91><b>Mini-Tests and Complete Tests</b></font><br><br>
        Both Mini-Tests and Complete Tests allow you to take realistic test sections and to measure your progress. A Mini-Test contains one half the tasks of a Complete Test.<br><br>
        The tests are timed, and you cannot check the answers during the test. You must wait until the end of the test to check answers and explanations.<br><br>
        Click on <b>Hide/Show Time</b>&nbsp;<img src='$IMAGE/6.gif' border=0> to see or hide the clock that shows how much time you have left in the test.

        <i>Screen 2: Sample Complete Test Screen</i>
    <p>
        At the end of each Reading and Listening test, you will move to a Summary screen. This screen tells you how many questions you answered correctly, incorrectly, or did not try to answer.<br><br>
        The complete <b>Results Report</b> gives you a total score at the top of the screen. It also shows you which questions were correct, incorrect, or not tried. You can click on questions that you want to review further. You will be able to see the correct answers and explanations.<br><br>
        In Writing and Speaking tests, the computer cannot give feedback on your responses. At the end of each Writing and Speaking test, you will move to a Checklist screen. This screen lets you score yourself on the skills you used in the responses. For each statement you click in the <i>Yes</i> column, you will receive one point in the Skill Report. See the Writing and Speaking Sections for more information.<br><br>
