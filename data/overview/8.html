<p>
<font size=16 color=#6F2C91><b>Results Report</b></font><br><br>
Each Results Report contains information for one Skills exercise or one Test. The report lists each question, the related skill from the <i>Longman Preparation Course for the TOEFL&reg; Test: Next Generation iBT</i>, and whether the answer was correct, incorrect, or not answered.<br><br>
Scores are shown in the upper right corner of the Results Report <img src='$IMAGE/1.gif' border=0>. Results Reports for Skills and Tests indicate the number of questions answered correctly before the answers were checked. Results Reports for Tests indicate the scaled TOEFL score.<br><br>
Double-click on a question <img src='$IMAGE/2.gif' border=0> to see the question and how you answered it (see Screen 2).

<font size=16 color=#6F2C91><b>Skill Reports</b></font><br><br>
Skill Reports are cumulative. They contain information about all of the Skills Practice exercises and Tests that you have taken. The skills are listed in order, along with the number of questions tried and the percentage answered correctly (see Screen 3). This will show you how well you are doing in each of the skills and which skills may need more practice.<br><br>
Skill reports include points from the Self-Assessment Checklists at the end of the Speaking and Writing sections. Each <i>Yes</i> check mark on the Self-Assessment Checklist counts as one point in the appropriate skill.
