<font size=16><b>How do I use the Speaking sections?</b></font><br>
<p>
In the Speaking section you will respond to questions to demonstrate your ability to speak about a variety of topics. There are three types of speaking tasks. You may take notes and use your notes to prepare your response in all three tasks. In an actual test your response will be scored on your ability to speak clearly and coherently about the topic.<br><br><br>
<font size=16 color=#005DA3><b>Speaking Question Types</b></font><br><br>
<b>Independent Speaking Tasks</b><br>
In the first type of speaking task, you will speak about a general and familiar topic.<br><br>
<b>Integrated Reading and Listening Tasks</b><br>
In the second type of speaking task, you will read a passage and listen to a lecture or conversation and then answer a question based on what you have read and heard. You will need to combine appropriate information from the reading passage and the listening passage to provide a complete answer to the question.<br><br>
<b>Integrated Listening Tasks</b><br>
In the third type of speaking task, you will listen to a part of a lecture or conversation and then answer a question about what you heard.

The Speaking section of the test allows you to take notes and use your notes while you give your response. In the Speaking Skills section of this program, you will practice taking notes for both Independent and Integrated tasks. You will take notes while reading a passage, listening to a passage, or preparing your answer to an Independent or Integrated question. You can then compare your notes with sample notes provided in the program.
