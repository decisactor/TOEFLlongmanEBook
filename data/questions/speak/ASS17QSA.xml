It was called a railroad because it was a way to help slaves escape to the north, and it was said to be underground because it was secret. Railroad words were used in it. "Passengers" were slaves who were trying to escape. "Conductors" were people who helped slaves to escape. "Stations" were safe houses.<br/><br/>Harriet Tubman was a former slave who used the Underground Railroad to escape from slavery in the South. Instead of relaxing in freedom after her escape, she went back to the South many times to help other slaves escape using the Underground Railroad.</sample-answer-text></essay>
