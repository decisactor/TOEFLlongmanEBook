Explain how this information on knowledge transfer is related to the concept of tacit knowledge.</question-text><sample-answer-text><b>SAMPLE ANSWER</b><br/>In this set of materials, the reading passage discusses the concept of tacit knowledge, and the professor explains how the transfer of knowledge in business is affected by tacit knowledge.<br/><br/>In the reading passage, tacit knowledge is defined as unspoken knowledge that a person tells only after he or she is specifically asked. An example of this is when person A knows how to do something but provides incomplete information to person B because some of person A's knowledge is tacit knowledge. Person B has to ask questions to get more complete information from person A.<br/><br/>In the talk, the professor discusses how the concept of tacit knowledge can be applied to business. There is a problem with knowledge transfer in business, with conveying information from employee to employee. It is easy for a business to tell employees how to transfer knowledge, with a memo, or a conversation, or a report, for example. It is not easy, however, to ensure that all necessary knowledge is transferred because some knowledge that needs to be transferred is tacit knowledge.</sample-answer-text></essay>
