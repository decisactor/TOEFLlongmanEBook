Ecologists like to talk about sustainability in terms of the ability of societies on Earth to continue to function over time without destroying natural resources such as land, air, and water without depleting or destroying these resources. However, the field of ecology is not the only place where the concept of sustainability is used; the concept of sustainability can be used to evaluate how well any system can manage to exist.</passage-text></passage>
