It is an intensive program of 25 units, which includes an eight-unit introductory course and electives.<br/><br/>In the discussion, the man points out that there is a problem in the announcement with the number of units required for the certificate. The announcement says that 25 units are required. However, the introductory course is eight units, and the electives are worth four units each.
