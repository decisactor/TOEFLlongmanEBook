A person with rational authority is someone who is experienced in working in an organized way to set up rules and procedures to maximize performance. A person with traditional authority is someone who is viewed as the rightful person to be in authority, perhaps through heredity or lineage. A person with charismatic authority is someone who possesses personal qualities that are attractive to others and make them want to follow him or her.</passage-text></passage>
