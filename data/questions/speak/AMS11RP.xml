The change that was taking place was what was viewed as a radical change&#8211;and hence the use of the term <i>revolution</i>&#8212;from private ownership of large companies to public ownership of corporations through publicly traded stocks and the accompanying change in management from management by private company owners to management by professional employees, rather than owners, of publicly traded corporations. The managerial revolution, as it was termed, was therefore the change from management by owners of private companies that had been prevalent in the early stages of industrial capitalism to the late twentieth-century style of management by professional managers who are employees, rather than owners, of publicly-owned corporations.</passage-text></passage>
