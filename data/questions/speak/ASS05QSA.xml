Teenagers barely sleep because of the work they have to do to get into a university. Even young children are given a lot of homework nowadays. I don't agree with this.<br/><br/>Children are at the one time in their lives when they can play and have fun. They don't have to worry about universities yet, about their future jobs or adult problems. Teachers who give them a lot of homework are taking away important play time. Children need the time after school to use their imaginations and learn social skills with other kids.<br/><br/>Of course it's important for children to learn good study habits while they are young, but society today demands too much of them. We ask them to be more responsible than they should be or can be at their young age. In the end, their parents often do some or all of the homework because the children can't. Parents should say "no" to teachers who give their children too much homework. It's not fair to the parents, and it's not fair to the children.</sample-answer-text></essay>
