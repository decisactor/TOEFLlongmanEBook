<?xml version='1.0'?><essay><question-text>Some people think it's better to live with a host family when studying abroad, while others prefer to get their own apartments. Which would you prefer, and why? Use reasons and examples to support your response.</question-text><sample-answer-text><b>SAMPLE ANSWER</b><br/>Both of these choices have benefits. I can say from experience many good things about living with a host family and many about living in an apartment.<br/><br/>When you live with a host family, you really get to learn what the culture of a country is like. You also get to practice speaking and learn a lot of useful vocabulary. If a person is shy, I think this is the best choice for them because they will feel protected and taken care of. Also, someone cooks for you, and you don't have to buy much because you'll have a bedroom with furniture in it already.<br/><br/>Living in an apartment has different advantages. With a host family, maybe you have to be home at a certain time, but in your own apartment, you're free. Anyone can come over, and you can come home very late at night without worrying. Also, if you don't like the food your host family makes, too bad, but in an apartment you can cook your own food. You can also have your home set up the way you want it, with the furniture you like.<br/><br/>I lived with a host family in Australia and in my own apartment in New York, and it's hard for me to say which I prefer. If I have to choose, I think I'll choose the apartment, but with roommates. The responsibility of the bills, cooking, and cleaning were very difficult for me, but I loved to be my own boss. It made me grow up a little more.</sample-answer-text></essay>
