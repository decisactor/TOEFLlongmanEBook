Then indicate what you think they should do, and explain why.</question-text><sample-answer-text><b>SAMPLE ANSWER</b><br/>In this conversation, two students who have been assigned to work together on a project are discussing how to get the project done. They have very different ways of approaching the project.<br/><br/>The woman likes to get work done early, and she wants both of them to start on the project now. She has even prepared a schedule for both of them.<br/><br/>The man seems to like taking time to get work done and wants to put off starting until later. He does not seem impressed with her schedule and suggests dividing tasks and working alone instead of following the schedule she prepared.<br/><br/>I think that her desire to get work done early is admirable, but it's a problem that she wants to impose her work habits on him. He makes a suggestion that will help to get the project done, but working separately doesn't seem like a good idea. They're supposed to work together, and they should find a way to do this. They have different work styles, so they each need to be prepared to change their workstyles somewhat so that they will be able to work together.</sample-answer-text></essay>
