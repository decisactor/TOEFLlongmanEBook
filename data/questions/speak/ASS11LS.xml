Well, it came about as a result of a battle for circulation between two rival newspapers in New York in the 1890s. One of the newspapers was the <i>New York World,</i> which was owned by Joseph Pulitzer, and the other was the <i>New York Journal,</i> which was owned by William Randolph Hearst. Each of these newspapers tried to outdo the other by creating stories that were more and more sensational and less and less factual. During this period, Pulitzer introduced a cartoon named <i>The Yellow Kid,</i> and this cartoon in Pulitzer's <i>New York World</i> became very popular. Drawing on the name of this popular cartoon character, the type of sensational stories that appeared in the two rival papers became known as yellow journalism.</paragraph></page></script>
