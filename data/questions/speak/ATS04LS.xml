Two things that I would like you to note about this earthquake are the length of the rupture of the fault and the amount of offset as a result of it. Concerning the length of the rupture, the fault broke apart for an amazing 290 miles&#8212;430 kilometers&#8212;about a third of the length of the fault. Concerning the offset, which is the amount of movement of one side of the fault in relation to the other side of the fault, there was offset of as much as 21 feet&#8212;7 meters&#8212;in some places along the San Andreas fault as a result of the San Francisco earthquake.</paragraph></page></script>
