Because of this unfortunate circumstance that has rendered the chemistry lab unusable, it has been necessary to close the lab until necessary repairs can improve the condition of the lab to a point that is once again usable. The staff of the chemistry lab sincerely regrets any inconvenience that this might cause students and faculty who make use of the lab as part of their research or studies. Repairs to the lab will commence at the soonest possible moment, and the lab will be reopened as soon as it is feasible (though, based on the current condition of the lab, it might take a considerable amount of time). Once again, the staff of the chemistry lab apologizes for this inconvenience.</passage-text></passage>
