Which classroom door?</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='woman' graphic-file='ATS03G1.jpg'>I guess you didn't see it, huh?</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='man' graphic-file='ATS03G1.jpg'>No, I don't know what you're talking about. There's a note on a door?</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='woman' graphic-file='ATS03G1.jpg'>Yeah, there's a note on Professor Allen's classroom door. He's sick, and he won't be here for the rest of the week.</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='man' graphic-file='ATS03G1.jpg'>I'm sorry he's sick, but at least we'll get a little break while he's gone.</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='woman' graphic-file='ATS03G1.jpg'>I wish we were getting a break, but&#8230;well, we're not.</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='man' graphic-file='ATS03G1.jpg'>What do you mean? If Professor Allen's not here, then we'll get a break from class, won't we?</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='woman' graphic-file='ATS03G1.jpg'>We'll get a break from class, but we won't get a break from work. The note gives us instructions to do some work, a lot of work, while the professor's gone.</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='man' graphic-file='ATS03G1.jpg'>What are we supposed to do?</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='woman' graphic-file='ATS03G1.jpg'>We have <u>three</u> chapters to read.</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='man' graphic-file='ATS03G1.jpg'><u>Three</u> chapters? That's a lot.</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='woman' graphic-file='ATS03G1.jpg'>Oh, but that's not all.</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='man' graphic-file='ATS03G1.jpg'>What else is there?</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='woman' graphic-file='ATS03G1.jpg'>We have to write one essay for each of the three chapters.</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='man' graphic-file='ATS03G1.jpg'>We have to write <u>three</u> essays?</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='woman' graphic-file='ATS03G1.jpg'>Yes, and have them ready to turn in on Monday.</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='man' graphic-file='ATS03G1.jpg'>That's a lot of work.</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='woman' graphic-file='ATS03G1.jpg'>It is, but that's still not quite all.</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='man' graphic-file='ATS03G1.jpg'>It's not?</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='woman' graphic-file='ATS03G1.jpg'>No, we also have to be prepared for a quiz on Monday.</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='man' graphic-file='ATS03G1.jpg'>A quiz, too? We're not getting any kind of break at all. In fact, this is a lot more work than we'd have if the professor weren't sick.</paragraph></page></script>
