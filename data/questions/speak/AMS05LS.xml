Suppose there are two brothers who each inherit a million dollars. Brother A is very careful with his money; he invests the money at 5 percent and has $50,000 a year, the 5 percent interest on the million dollars, to spend. He lives off the interest on the million dollars, but doesn't spend the original million dollars. After 20 years, he still has the original million dollars.<br/><br/>Brother B starts out with the same million dollars, but he enjoys spending money more than his brother does. He invests the money at 5 percent, as his brother does, but he doesn't stick with spending only the $50,000 interest per year. Instead, he spends $100,000 dollars per year, which cuts into the original million dollars. Within 20 years, all of his money is long gone.<br/><br/>In terms of their money, one brother is living sustainably, and the other is not.</paragraph></page></script>
