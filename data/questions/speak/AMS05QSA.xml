A point made in the passage is that the concept of sustainability is commonly used in ecology but that it can also be applied in many other areas.<br/><br/>The listening passage provides an example of sustainability in the financial lives of two brothers. There are two brothers who each inherit a million dollars. Brother A lives sustainably by investing the money and living only on the interest. This is sustainable because he keeps all of the million dollars and can continue living this way over time. Brother B does not live sustainably because he regularly spends part of the original million dollars. This is not sustainable because the million dollars will eventually all be spent and then he can't continue living this way.</sample-answer-text></essay>
