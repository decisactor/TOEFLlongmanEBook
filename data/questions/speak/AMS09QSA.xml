The professor then goes on to provide an example of a problem with the use of the noun <u>man</u>, which can also be used in a countable or an uncountable way. In 1969, when Neil Armstrong first took a step on the moon, he said, "One small step for a man&#8230;;" he used <u>man</u> in the countable sense meaning that one man took a step, which is exactly what had happened. However, when the words were transmitted to Earth, there was a problem with the transmission, and people on Earth heard him say, "One small step for man&#8230;" without the article and with <u>man</u> used in the uncountable sense meaning <u>humanity</u>. The meaning that people heard on Earth didn't make sense because it wasn't all of humanity that took the step on the moon; it was just one man.</sample-answer-text></essay>
