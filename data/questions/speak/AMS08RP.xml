Please note that I expect you to be knowledgeable about current events in politics and government at the local, state, and federal levels.  Please also note that I expect you to have an understanding of current events from several perspectives, so it is not acceptable to read about an event in only a single source.  Finally, please note that I quite commonly find it useful to measure just how much knowledge you have about current happenings in politics and government.</passage-text></passage>
