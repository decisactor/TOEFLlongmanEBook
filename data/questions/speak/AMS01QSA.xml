Include reasons and examples in your response.</question-text><sample-answer-text><b>SAMPLE ANSWER</b><br/>If I had the time to study anything I wanted, I would love to study architecture. For as long as I can remember, I've loved walking into ancient and even not-so-ancient buildings and admiring the ways they were designed and built.<br/><br/>When you go into a very old building, the architecture tells you so much about the people who used it. You can tell what they valued and how they lived. What was important to them? Religion? Beauty? The seasons? For example, in some areas, people's houses used to be very open to the nature around them because nature was very important to them.<br/><br/>You can even see this in more recent architecture. A lot of houses and buildings built in the 1950s and 1960s have a futuristic look because people then were looking to the future and outer space. Others have strange geometric shapes, which shows a period when nonconformity was acceptable in society. Architecture is an interesting window on society.<br/><br/>These are just some reasons I would really enjoy studying architecture. If I have time in the future, I hope I can actually do it!</sample-answer-text></essay>
