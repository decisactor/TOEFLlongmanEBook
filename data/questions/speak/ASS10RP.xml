<?xml version='1.0'?><passage><passage-text><div align='center'><i>New Scientific Ideas</i></div><br/>In the world of science, it can be a difficult proposition to introduce new ideas to the scientific community. After a theory or method has become established, the scientific world tends to view it as the norm. Any attempt to propose a different theory or method is viewed with suspicion.<br/>There are many accepted scientists today who in the past were out of the mainstream of science at some point because they held views that did not follow accepted theory or methodology. There are also many scientists today who are out of the mainstream now but who may become accepted in the future.</passage-text></passage>
