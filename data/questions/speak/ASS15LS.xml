What's the matter?</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='woman' graphic-file='ASS15G1.jpg'>It's the assignment we just got back in management class. I didn't do very well on it.</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='man' graphic-file='ASS15G1.jpg'>Did you work very hard on it?</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='woman' graphic-file='ASS15G1.jpg'>I spent a whole lot of time on it. I really worked hard. I went to the library and researched the issue, and I spent hours writing the paper.</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='man' graphic-file='ASS15G1.jpg'>Do you understand why the grade was so low? Maybe I can help.</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='woman' graphic-file='ASS15G1.jpg'>Did you do well on the assignment?</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='man' graphic-file='ASS15G1.jpg'>Yes, I did.</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='woman' graphic-file='ASS15G1.jpg'>Then I think you can help. Do you have any ideas?</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='man' graphic-file='ASS15G1.jpg'>A couple, based on what you just said. First of all, you said you went to the library and researched the theory we were supposed to write about.</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='woman' graphic-file='ASS15G1.jpg'>Yes, I did. I researched it thoroughly.</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='man' graphic-file='ASS15G1.jpg'>Well, the assignment was to write <u>your opinion</u> of the theory. The professor said very specifically that she wanted our thoughts on it. Did you give your opinion on the theory in your paper?</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='woman' graphic-file='ASS15G1.jpg'>Well, first I wrote about the history of the theory, from all my research, and then later in the paper I talked about what the theory means.</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='man' graphic-file='ASS15G1.jpg'>Not your opinion about it?</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='woman' graphic-file='ASS15G1.jpg'>No, not exactly&#8230;.</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='man' graphic-file='ASS15G1.jpg'>Well, the professor wanted our opinion&#8230;.</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='woman' graphic-file='ASS15G1.jpg'>I see that now. That was my problem, I'm sure.</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='man' graphic-file='ASS15G1.jpg'>Just a minute. One more thing. When you said "later in the paper," what did you mean? I mean, how long was your paper?</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='woman' graphic-file='ASS15G1.jpg'><u>Just</u> eight pages.</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='man' graphic-file='ASS15G1.jpg'>Just eight pages? The professor said she wanted answers that are <u>succinct</u> and <u>to the point</u>. She really stressed that.</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='woman' graphic-file='ASS15G1.jpg'>So you think she didn't appreciate the eight-page paper?</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='man' graphic-file='ASS15G1.jpg'>Not exactly.</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='woman' graphic-file='ASS15G1.jpg'>By the way, how long was your paper, the one you got a high grade on?</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='man' graphic-file='ASS15G1.jpg'>Under two pages.</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='woman' graphic-file='ASS15G1.jpg'>Under two pages? And you got a high grade? Oh, my!</paragraph></page></script>
