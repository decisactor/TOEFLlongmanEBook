For decisions about things that don't really matter, it may be OK, but decisions that can have lasting repercussions should be thought through with care.<br/><br/>When someone has only a short time to decide something important like which school to attend or which job offer to take, he or she might make a poor decision because of stress. Deciding on a school or job requires research and a careful look at the pros and cons of each option. People who are in a rush to decide can easily overlook important considerations and make the wrong choice because something looked good just at first glance.<br/><br/>Three years ago, I had to make an important decision in a very short time, a decision about what job to take, and I didn't make the best choice. I was in a rush and didn't think things through. I would've made a better choice if I had just asked for more time to decide. This is why I really believe important decisions shouldn't be made too quickly.</sample-answer-text></essay>
