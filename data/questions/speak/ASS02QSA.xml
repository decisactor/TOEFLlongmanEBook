Include reasons and examples to support your response.</question-text><sample-answer-text><b>SAMPLE ANSWER</b><br/>I'm from a little colonial town in Mexico. The people are honest and friendly, and there's a lot to do there when I'm not studying. There is one thing I would love to change, though. We have a lot of garbage, and we don't have any recycling.<br/><br/>Last year at my university, the student Environmental Club started a recycling program on campus. They visited all the professors and students with information about the program, and most of us tried hard to put plastic, paper, and glass in the new recycling containers. Some months after they started, though, I stayed very late to study, and I saw the custodian put all the recycling in the regular garbage!  When I asked him why he'd done this, he said it was because there's no place to send the recycled stuff because there's no facility for recycling near here. Isn't that crazy?<br/><br/>If we had a place for recycling near my town, I think it would be better for us. I don't think the town government will change this soon, but if I could change one thing, I would change that.</sample-answer-text></essay>
