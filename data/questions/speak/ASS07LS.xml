What are we going to do?</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='man' graphic-file='ASS07G1.jpg'>What do you mean?</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='woman' graphic-file='ASS07G1.jpg'>Well, we have lab assignments to complete in the lab each week for our chemistry class, and we won't be able to get into the lab to do them.</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='man' graphic-file='ASS07G1.jpg'>Oh, the professor's going to have to do something about that. She can't assign us to work in the lab if there's no lab to work in.</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='woman' graphic-file='ASS07G1.jpg'>So you think it's her problem and not ours?</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='man' graphic-file='ASS07G1.jpg'>I do. By the way, did you hear what happened to the lab, I mean, why it's unusable now?</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='woman' graphic-file='ASS07G1.jpg'>No, I didn't. I heard that it's closed, but I didn't hear why. Do you know what happened?</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='man' graphic-file='ASS07G1.jpg'>Well, I don't know for sure, but I did hear a story from some of my friends.</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='woman' graphic-file='ASS07G1.jpg'>What did you hear?</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='man' graphic-file='ASS07G1.jpg'>I heard that someone was in the lab working on an experiment and this person had some sort of accident that caused a big explosion.</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='woman' graphic-file='ASS07G1.jpg'>I think it's pretty obvious that something like that happened.</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='man' graphic-file='ASS07G1.jpg'>But here's the good part.</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='woman' graphic-file='ASS07G1.jpg'>There's a good part in all of this?</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='man' graphic-file='ASS07G1.jpg'>Yes, there is. Guess who I heard blew up the lab.</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='woman' graphic-file='ASS07G1.jpg'>Who?</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='man' graphic-file='ASS07G1.jpg'><u>Our</u> chemistry professor.</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='woman' graphic-file='ASS07G1.jpg'>No!</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='man' graphic-file='ASS07G1.jpg'>That's what I heard.</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='woman' graphic-file='ASS07G1.jpg'>It would really be funny if that's really what happened.</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='man' graphic-file='ASS07G1.jpg'>It certainly would!</paragraph></page></script>
