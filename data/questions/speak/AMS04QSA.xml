You can't do anything without money. I see poor people begging on the street every day in my country, and even a little money can make a big difference to them.<br/><br/>You know, in my country, we say, "Money makes the dog dance."  This means that if you have enough money, you can have anything. In the popular discos in my hometown, everyone dresses up and stands in a long, long line to go inside. The man at the entrance only lets the handsome boys and beautiful girls enter. Yet, even if you are not dressed well or you don't look beautiful, if you have enough money you can pay the man to let you in. Money gets you everything!<br/><br/>Everybody has to work. Why? Because they need money! They need money to pay the rent and electricity, to buy clothes, to put gas in the car, and so on. That's why we work as long as we can, until we are old. But it doesn't take a lot of money to survive, especially where I live. Also, I have two roommates in my house, so I don't pay as much rent as if I lived alone. If people are careful and they share expenses like rent, it really doesn't require a lot of money, and you can even have some extra for fun things.</sample-answer-text></essay>
