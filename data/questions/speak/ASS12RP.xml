It is unspoken knowledge that comes to light only when the person who possesses the knowledge is specifically asked about it.<br/>When person A knows how to do some task and tries to explain how to do the task to person B, the explanation by person A will most likely not be complete, and the incomplete explanation by person A will force person B to have to ask questions to get enough information to complete the task. In this situation, the explanation by person A is incomplete because some of the knowledge of how do to the task is <i>tacit knowledge</i>. It is knowledge that person A does not easily share because he or she does not recognize either that he or she has the knowledge or that the other person needs the knowledge.</passage-text></passage>
