They will not be able to complete the lab work that has been assigned for their chemistry class; the woman seems more concerned about this than the man does. One interesting point in all of this is that the man has heard a rumor that it was their own chemistry professor who caused an explosion that damaged the lab. The students seem to be amused at this thought.</sample-answer-text></essay>
