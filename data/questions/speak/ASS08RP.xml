In order to remedy this situation, the decision has been reached that library privileges will be suspended for any students who have failed to return materials or have failed to pay required late fees. This means that students whose library privileges have been suspended will not be able to check out any further library materials until any delinquencies have been cleared.</passage-text></passage>
