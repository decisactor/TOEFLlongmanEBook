Then state which of the two choices you prefer, and explain why.</question-text><sample-answer-text><b>SAMPLE ANSWER</b><br/>In this conversation, the man is talking with the woman about when he should take a course. It is a very hard statistics course that he has to take, and she has already taken it.<br/><br/>He can take the course in either the summer or the fall. In the summer, the course is very condensed; the whole course is taught in only two weeks. In the fall, the course is spread out over 10 weeks.<br/><br/>The woman recommends to him to take the course in the fall, over 10 weeks instead of two weeks, and I agree with her. It's a very hard course, and because it's so hard, it's better to spread it out over 10 weeks in the fall. Only certain courses, courses that are really easy, are good to take in a very short time.</sample-answer-text></essay>
