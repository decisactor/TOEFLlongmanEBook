Businesses are concerned about knowledge transfer, that is, how to transfer knowledge about accomplishing a variety of tasks from one part of an organization to another. But difficulty is inherent in a transfer of knowledge and this difficulty arises because of the problem of transferring tacit knowledge. Businesses can easily provide a method for the transfer of knowledge, saying perhaps that certain knowledge is to be transferred in a written report or memo or e-mail or through an oral report or conversation. However, when information about how to do a certain task is communicated from one employee to another, there will most likely be gaps in the information that has been transferred due to the inability of the employee who is providing the information that he or she tacitly knows but fails to understand needs to be transferred.</paragraph></page></script>
