Students must take all prerequisites before applying to the Engineering Department for a major in engineering. (For a list of prerequisites for an engineering major, see page 249.)  Only students with a minimum average of 3.0, or B, in the engineering prerequisite courses may apply, and only top candidates will be selected from the pool of applicants. Applications for acceptance as an engineering major must be submitted by April 1, and lists of students who have been accepted as engineering majors for the coming academic year will be posted by June 1.</passage-text></passage>
