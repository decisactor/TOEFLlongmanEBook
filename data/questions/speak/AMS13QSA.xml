Include reasons and details to support your response.</question-text><sample-answer-text><b>SAMPLE ANSWER</b><br/>That's a funny question because I'm from a place most people don't visit: Yakutsk, Russia. It's a city in Siberia, by the Lena River, some hours north of Korea by plane. It's hard to get there most of the year and nearly impossible in winter. However, it's a very friendly city, and there definitely are some places visitors should see if they come!<br/><br/>The first place I would take a visitor to is the Museum of Diamonds and Precious Stones. It's not a very big museum, but it has all the minerals that come from my part of Siberia, like diamonds, emeralds, gold, and charoite, which is a purple stone that is found only in this part of the world.<br/><br/>The other place I would take visitors is Three Mammoths. It's a place for celebrations that is very traditional in style to show how life was for the native Yakut people in the past. The people who work there wear traditional clothes and demonstrate Yakut songs, and the visitors get to see all of this and also get to try traditional Yakut foods like an alcoholic drink made from horse's milk and frozen raw river fish.<br/>If you come to visit, these places are really the two best places to visit, and you'll have fantastic memories of Yakutsk.</sample-answer-text></essay>
