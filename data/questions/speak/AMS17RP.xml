<?xml version='1.0'?><passage><passage-text><div align='center'><i>Nature and Nurture</i></div><br/>There has been a long-standing controversy among sociologists, psychologists, philosophers, and ethicists over whether human character and behavior are influenced more by nature or by nurture. Advocates of the nature-over-nurture position support the premise that a person's character and behavior are influenced primarily by what a person is born with, by genetic inheritance from his or her parents. In contrast, advocates of the nurture-over-nature position support the premise that a person's character and behavior are primarily influenced by the environment into which he or she is born, that is, by the way that he or she was raised, by the experiences that the individual has had, by what this individual has learned since birth.</passage-text></passage>
