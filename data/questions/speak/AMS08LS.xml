I saw you there this morning. My name's Kate.</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='man' graphic-file='AMS08G1.jpg'>And I'm Rich. Listen, did you read the syllabus the professor handed out this morning?</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='woman' graphic-file='AMS08G1.jpg'>Yes, I did.</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='man' graphic-file='AMS08G1.jpg'>And did you see the part at the end? The part about outside reading?</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='woman' graphic-file='AMS08G1.jpg'>I certainly did.</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='man' graphic-file='AMS08G1.jpg'>Could you believe that? I mean, I've never seen something like that on a class syllabus.</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='woman' graphic-file='AMS08G1.jpg'>I was actually expecting it.</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='man' graphic-file='AMS08G1.jpg'>You were? Why?</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='woman' graphic-file='AMS08G1.jpg'>Well, my roommate took this class last quarter, and I heard all about it.</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='man' graphic-file='AMS08G1.jpg'>You mean, the professor really does expect us to read several newspapers and magazines every day?</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='woman' graphic-file='AMS08G1.jpg'>Pretty much. And then we have a lot of quizzes on current events.</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='man' graphic-file='AMS08G1.jpg'>Quizzes?</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='woman' graphic-file='AMS08G1.jpg'>Yes, really often. You remember the part on the syllabus where the professor says that it's useful to "measure" how much we know about current events?</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='man' graphic-file='AMS08G1.jpg'>Yes. So that means we're going to have a lot of quizzes?</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='woman' graphic-file='AMS08G1.jpg'>From what I've heard from my roommate, there'll be <u>lots</u> of quizzes.</paragraph></page></script>
