Include reasons and examples to support your response.</question-text><sample-answer-text><b>SAMPLE ANSWER</b><br/>My generation&#8212;people in their early twenties&#8212;is different from older generations in many ways. I'd like to talk about two of them.<br/><br/>The biggest difference is that we aren't as traditional as our parents or grandparents. In earlier generations in my country, it was very common to take care of your parents or grandparents when they got old. They usually moved into the house of the oldest daughter, and she helped to take care of them. Some people still live in this way, and it has benefits, like the grandparents watch the little grandchildren. But it's not so common now as it was 20 or 40 years ago. I think this is actually a sad difference.<br/><br/>Another difference is obedience. The generation before us was more obedient than we are. They always did what their parents made them do. When my grandfather told my father to be an accountant, my father said "yes." He doesn't even like math! But he became an accountant because his father demanded it. Children today aren't so obedient. When our parents say to do something, we cry or complain or sometimes we don't do it; my parents have told me some majors that they would like for me to study at the university, but I don't know if I will choose one of them. Because of this change, I sometimes wonder what will happen when I have children and grandchildren. I'm almost afraid to think about that!</sample-answer-text></essay>
