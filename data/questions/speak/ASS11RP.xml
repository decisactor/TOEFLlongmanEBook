A journalist trying to write a really sensational story may do so by presenting only one side of the story, by emphasizing the lurid details of the story, by exaggerating what actually happened, or by relying on unsubstantiated sources. Newspapers may then add to the sensationalism of stories by putting these stories on the front page and using banner headlines or huge photos that depict the most tantalizing or horrifying aspects of the sensationalized stories.</passage-text></passage>
