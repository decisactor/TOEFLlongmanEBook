Pluto's orbit is usually outside Neptune's, but because Pluto's orbit is elliptical, it is inside Neptune's orbit occasionally, every 248 years.<br/><br/>The theory about why Pluto's orbit is so unusual is that Pluto may not be a planet. Perhaps Pluto used to be one of Neptune's moons and used to be in orbit around Neptune. Then it broke out of Neptune's orbit and is now in an irregular orbit around the Sun.</sample-answer-text></essay>
