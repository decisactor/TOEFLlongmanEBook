She got a bad grade on the assignment, and he got a high grade; so she wants to know why.<br/><br/>As they discuss how she did the assignment, the man begins to understand why her grade on the assignment was not good. First, she researched the theory they were supposed to discuss and presented factual information on it, when the professor wanted opinions instead of facts. Second, the woman wrote too much when the professor had asked for a paper that was succinct and to the point. She wrote eight pages, and the man's well-written assignment was under two pages.<br/><br/>From this, it's important for the woman to learn from her mistakes. She should learn that it's important to follow a professor's directions exactly. If the professor says to write her opinion, then she should write opinions rather than facts.
