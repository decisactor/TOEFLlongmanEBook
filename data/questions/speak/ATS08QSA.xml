Support your response with reasons and examples.</question-text><sample-answer-text><b>SAMPLE ANSWER</b><br/>People like different things when they travel. Some like to go off on their own, and others like to travel with tour groups. When I'm traveling to a foreign country, I prefer to go with a tour group if I can, particularly the first time I visit a place.<br/><br/>My job gives me a lot of vacation time when my friends can't leave their jobs, so I usually go by myself when I travel. I like traveling, but doing everything alone isn't as much fun as doing things with other people. That's why I prefer to join planned tours when I can. I get to meet a lot of other people on each tour group, and we learn about each other's countries in addition to the places we visit.<br/><br/>Besides that, I feel that I learn more about the cities I visit when I'm with a tour group. The guide tells us about the history of the places we go to and gives us a lot of interesting facts. When I travel on my own, I read a guidebook, but it's not the same, and it's not nearly as interesting. I can't ask a guidebook questions.<br/><br/>After I've visited someplace new with a tour group, I might go back and explore it further on my own because I'll already be familiar with the place. However, the first time I go, it's more rewarding and a lot easier to simply go on a planned tour.</sample-answer-text></essay>
