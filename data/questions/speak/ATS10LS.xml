A certain family-owned manufacturing company was purchased by Corporation X soon after the death of the company's owner. After acquiring the manufacturing company, Corporation X had to make a decision about who would lead the manufacturing company. Three people were under consideration by Corporation X to lead the company.<br/><br/>The first candidate was Alex, the son of the previous owner of the manufacturing company. Everyone expected Alex to take over the company after his father's death, and it was a great surprise to everyone when the company was purchased by Corporation X and Alex did not automatically become the head of the manufacturing company.<br/><br/>The second candidate was Beth, a woman who had worked her way up through Corporation X over a long period of time. She has always worked very systematically and has been very successful in each position she has held over the years that she has been with Corporation X.<br/><br/>The third candidate is Carl, who is an awfully well-liked person. Although he's fairly new to Corporation X, he gets along with everyone, and when he speaks out at meetings, everyone listens with awe and automatically supports whatever point he is making.</paragraph></page></script>
