Include reasons and examples to support your response.</question-text><sample-answer-text><b>SAMPLE ANSWER</b><br/>I think that if you look at the most successful people in the world, you'll find two characteristics: tenacity and luck.<br/>The most important characteristic of a successful person is tenacity&#8212;never giving up. Everyone experiences failure in some form or another. Successful people are those who don't let failure stop them. They never take "no" for an answer. The biggest example that comes to mind is the famous U.S. President Abraham Lincoln. He tried to be in government many times and lost several elections before he finally won and became president. He didn't give up after losing any elections, so he eventually was successful.<br/><br/>However, I think it's also important to be lucky. This isn't something that a person can control. Sometimes you are simply lucky, or you're not. Inventing the right thing at the right time is an example of how luck comes into play. In my country, we say it's better to be lucky than to be rich. If you're lucky and poor, you may be rich one day, but if you're rich and unlucky, you'll be in trouble.<br/><br/>Being lucky really helps, but if you never give up, if you have tenacity, maybe you can create your own good luck and reach success.</sample-answer-text></essay>
