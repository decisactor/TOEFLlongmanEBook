Someone got hurt in the scuffle, and the police were called to break up the scuffle. An ambulance took the person who was seriously injured to the hospital.<br/><br/>In the listening passage, the man says that he was actually at the game and that the account in the newspaper was incorrect in many different ways. One way is that it was two parents who rushed onto the field and not a large number of spectators, and the parents ran out onto the field because their son, who was playing in the game, was hurt. It was not true that someone got hurt in the scuffle; it was one of the players who got hurt in the game, and police were not called to break up a scuffle, as the newspaper said. According to the man, it was also not true that the injured person was taken to the hospital; instead, the parents took their son home themselves. Finally, the guy was not seriously injured, as the newspaper said, because the man saw him in class this morning.</sample-answer-text></essay>
