It has saved lives and made the world a smaller place, but it has also created dangers that never existed before.<br/><br/>On the positive side, technology has made the world a smaller place. With telephones, people can talk to family and friends anywhere on Earth. With the Internet, people can see what's happening in other countries as it happens&#8212;we don't have to wait for the newspaper to print photos. With airplanes, we can travel anywhere on Earth in a short time. This is great!<br/><br/>But technology sometimes has bad side effects, too. Now we have nuclear energy giving us power, but what do we do with nuclear waste? Millions of people have cell phones, but we aren't sure if the phones cause cancer. Pollution from much of our technology, like airplanes, is destroying the environment. We create a lot of trash, too. What do we do?<br/><br/>This is why I don't agree that all the effects of technology have been positive. I'm happy about the positive effects, but we need to do something about the negative effects while we still can.</sample-answer-text></essay>
