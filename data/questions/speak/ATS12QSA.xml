The lecture discusses how the bison almost became extinct and what steps have been taken to save it.<br/><br/>The situation a few hundred years ago was that there were probably 50 million bison in North America. Then the Transcontinental Railroad was built across America in the middle of the nineteenth century. This meant that many people began moving to the West, and the bison were divided into two herds, one south of the railroad and one north of the railroad. The bison were overhunted, and by 1900 the southern herd was extinct, and there were only a few hundred bison in the northern herd.<br/><br/>In the early 1900s, organizations were founded to save the bison, and preserves were established to protect them. Today, there are more than 30,000 bison in North America.</sample-answer-text></essay>
