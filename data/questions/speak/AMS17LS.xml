The nature position in this debate is that intelligence is inherited from one's parents and, thus, that performance on intelligence tests is based on genetic make up, on what we're born with.<br/><br/>Now, the nurture position in the debate is the opposite, as you would expect. The nurture position is that individuals inherit basically the same mental abilities from their parents, that all individuals are born with relatively equal intelligence, and that any measured differences on intelligence tests are due to experiences and learning since birth.</paragraph></page></script>
