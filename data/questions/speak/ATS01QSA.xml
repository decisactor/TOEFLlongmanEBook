Use reasons and details to support your response.</question-text><sample-answer-text><b>SAMPLE ANSWER</b><br/>When I need to relax, there's a wonderful place near my home where I can go and get rid of all my cares and worries. There's a creek near my home, and there's a wonderful spot on a rock above the creek where I can sit in the sunshine with my feet in the moving water.<br/><br/>Why do I like this place so much? Well, first of all, this spot by the creek is a quiet place, where the only sound is the sound of the water moving in the creek. I'm all alone there; no one's there to disturb me.<br/><br/>The most important reason why I like this place so much, however, is that it's a magical spot, one where I can feel the heat of the sunshine on my face and the coolness of the water on my feet. It is impossible to feel bad in such a wonderful place.</sample-answer-text></essay>
