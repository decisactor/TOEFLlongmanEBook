State what the admission policy is and how one of the students was confused about it.</question-text><sample-answer-text><b>SAMPLE ANSWER</b><br/>In this set of materials, the reading passage is the section of a university catalogue that deals with admission to an engineering major, and the listening passage is a discussion by two students of that section of the catalogue.<br/><br/>According to the reading passage, the procedures for admission to an engineering major are that students must take all prerequisites before they apply, must get a minimum average of 3.0, or B, in their prerequisites, must apply for admission to the engineering department by April 1, and then see if they are admitted on June 1. Only some of the students who meet these criteria are actually admitted.<br/><br/>In the listening passage, the students discuss what it says in that section of the university catalogue about being admitted by the engineering department as an engineering major. The woman seems clear about what it takes to be admitted; she knows that students need a B average in the prerequisite courses to apply but that a B average does not guarantee acceptance. The man does not seem clear about this; he seems to think that a B average will guarantee acceptance as an engineering major, but this is not the case. In reality, only about half of the students who apply with a B average are actually admitted as engineering majors.</sample-answer-text></essay>
