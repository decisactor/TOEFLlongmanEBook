Three ways that the saguaro cactus is able to adapt to its environment are discussed.<br/><br/>The first way that the saguaro cactus adapts to its environment is through its shallow and widespread root system. The root system spreads out, so the cactus can gather more water.<br/><br/>The second way that the saguaro cactus adapts to its environment is through slowed growth. It grows very slowly, so it can survive without much food and water.<br/><br/>The third way that the saguaro cactus adapts to its environment is through its ability to expand and contract depending on how much water is available. When the weather is very dry, the cactus contracts. When the weather is wet, it expands to hold water. In this way, it can make any water that is available last.</sample-answer-text></essay>
