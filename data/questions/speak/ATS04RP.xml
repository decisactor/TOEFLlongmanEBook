Two of these gigantic plates, the Pacific plate and the American plate, come together in California, and the 860-mile (1,300-kilometer) border between them is known as the San Andreas fault. The Pacific plate, the plate to the west of the San Andreas fault, is moving in a northerly direction in relation to the American plate to the east of the fault; at the rate that these plates are moving in opposing directions, Los Angeles will be in Alaska in about 70 million years. This movement of the plates in opposing directions along the San Andreas fault causes numerous earthquakes there.</passage-text></passage>
