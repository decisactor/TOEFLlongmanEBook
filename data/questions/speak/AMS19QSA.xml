Include reasons and details in your response.</question-text><sample-answer-text><b>SAMPLE ANSWER</b><br/>My life is full of stress. I work hard and have little time for myself. Therefore it's important for me to relieve my stress sometimes. To do that, I practice aikido and go for walks.<br/><br/>Three times every week, I relieve stress by practicing the Japanese martial art of aikido. Because we fall and throw people a lot in aikido, it takes energy and helps me relax. It's tiring, sweaty work, but by the end of the workout, I feel better than when I started. Also, when I'm concentrating on certain throws, I'm not thinking about my schoolwork or things that I have to do.<br/><br/>On days when I don't have aikido I sometimes go for long walks at a fast pace around my neighborhood to get rid of stress. This gives me time without interruptions to think about what I have to do, to plan, and to collect my thoughts. By walking quickly, I use my extra energy, and I find the quiet, private time for myself pretty relaxing.<br/><br/>If I didn't do these things, all my stress would take over my life.</sample-answer-text></essay>
