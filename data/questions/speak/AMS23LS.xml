In 1804, while Burr was serving as vice president of the United States, he challenged Alexander Hamilton to a duel. Alexander Hamilton was a noted statesman and former secretary of the treasury under George Washington, and he had publicly criticized Burr's character, so Burr challenged him to a duel. The duel took place, and Burr fatally wounded Hamilton. Burr was charged with Hamilton's murder, though a trial never took place.<br/><br/>The second situation was when Burr tried to establish his own empire. While still serving as vice president, Burr also began working on a plot to create an empire in North America, with New Orleans as its capital. He had already tried to get the British to help finance the plot, and he had created a small army when the plot was discovered. He was arrested and tried for treason, though he was not found guilty because he had not actually put the plot into action.</paragraph></page></script>
