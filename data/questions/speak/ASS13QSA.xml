Then indicate what you think of the two methods, and explain why.</question-text><sample-answer-text><b>SAMPLE ANSWER</b><br/>In the conversation, the students are discussing a paper they have to write, and they have very different ways of writing a paper.<br/>The woman's method is to plan a whole lot. She has been working on the outline for two days.<br/><br/>The man's method is to not plan at all. He writes without planning at all and then maybe goes back and fixes the organization.<br/><br/>I think that the best method is somewhere between these two extremes. It is good to plan before you write, but the woman here spent too much time planning. And the man didn't spend enough time planning. When I write a paper, I like to spend some time planning and then get started on the writing after I have spent some time planning.</sample-answer-text></essay>
