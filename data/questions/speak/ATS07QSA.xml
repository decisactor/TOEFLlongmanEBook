Include reasons and examples in your response.</question-text><sample-answer-text><b>SAMPLE ANSWER</b><br/>Tupac Shakur was truly one of the great rappers of our generation, and he's my favorite musician, no question. Some people don't like rap music, but if they listened to Tupac's songs, they might change their minds.<br/><br/>When most people think of rap music, they probably think of violence, drugs, bad words, and things like that. Maybe they think it all has a bad message. Tupac's songs have violence and cussing, but a lot of his songs have good messages, too!  For example, in his song "Changes," he complains about his life, but then he says that you shouldn't give up. I think a lot of his songs have that message: Just don't give up.<br/><br/>I also like his music because of what he does with rhyming words and rhythm. If you read his lyrics while you listen to a song, you'll see that it's very complicated. You can hear words that sound similar many times in just two or four lines&#8212;it's amazing! Eminem is the only other rapper who comes close to Tupac's skill. It's unfortunate that Tupac's not alive anymore because the world lost a great man when he died.</sample-answer-text></essay>
