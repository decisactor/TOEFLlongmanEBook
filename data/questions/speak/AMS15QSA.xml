The professor mentions a well-known example of a geyser, Old Faithful in Yellowstone National Park. Old Faithful is well known, not because it's so big, but because it erupts so regularly, every 77 minutes.<br/><br/>The professor then makes an interesting point about geysers. The interesting point is that geysers are not located evenly around the world. Instead, they are basically found only in four places, and 400 of the 700 geysers in the world are in Yellowstone.</sample-answer-text></essay>
