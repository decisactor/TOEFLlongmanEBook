Then state which method you prefer, and explain why.</question-text><sample-answer-text><b>SAMPLE ANSWER</b><br/>In this conversation, the man and woman are discussing how they prepare for exams.<br/><br/>The man just did what he usually does. He didn't prepare at all the week before an exam, and then he stayed up all night studying for the exam. He went to class and took the exam without any sleep.<br/><br/>The woman says that she doesn't prepare that way for exams. When she has an exam, she usually prepares each evening for a week before an exam. Then she gets a lot of sleep the night before the exam.<br/><br/>I think that the woman's way of preparing for an exam is by far the best. It's really good to prepare for exams that way. However, I'm not usually able to do that. I usually procrastinate every evening for a week before an exam and then end up having to stay up all night the night before an exam to study for it.</sample-answer-text></essay>
