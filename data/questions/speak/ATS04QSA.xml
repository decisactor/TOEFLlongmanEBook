Explain how this information on a particular earthquake is related to the information on the San Andreas fault.</question-text><sample-answer-text><b>SAMPLE ANSWER</b><br/>In this set of materials, the reading passage discusses the San Andreas fault, and the professor describes a major earthquake that took place on this fault.<br/><br/>The reading passage says that the San Andreas fault is an 860-mile&#8212;1,300-kilometer&#8212;fault where two huge plates, the Pacific plate and the American plate, meet in California. The Pacific plate is moving north in relation to the American plate, so Los Angeles is slowly moving toward Alaska because of this movement.<br/><br/>In the talk, the professor discusses one major earthquake that occurred along the San Andreas fault; this was the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Two notable characteristics of this earthquake are the length of the rupture and the length of the offset. During this earthquake, 290 miles&#8212;430 kilometers&#8212;of the fault ruptured; the offset, or the amount that the sides of the fault moved in relation to each other, was 21 feet&#8212;7 meters&#8212;in some places.</sample-answer-text></essay>
