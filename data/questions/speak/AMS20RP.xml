Since it was first announced that a certain guest speaker was scheduled to give a talk on Friday evening, the university has received a considerable amount of criticism for scheduling a speaker who is known for his controversial stances on issues that are important to our campus community. In response to all of these criticisms, the university has decided that it is best to cancel the event on Friday evening. Anyone who has already purchased tickets for the event may return the tickets to the ticket office for a complete refund.</passage-text></passage>
