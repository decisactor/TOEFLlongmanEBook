Because he will miss two sections of History 127 on Thursday and Friday, he has asked that the students in these two sections complete some work while he is away from campus. Before next Monday's class, he would like you to read Chapters 9, 10, and 11 in the text and answer the essay question at the end of each chapter. He would like you to have your essays ready to turn in at next Monday's class and would also like you to be prepared for a quiz on the three chapters that he has asked you to read.</passage-text></passage>
