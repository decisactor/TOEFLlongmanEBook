Because so many hours of classes were cancelled, the administrative board has held extensive discussions to determine the best solution to the problem and has arrived at the decision that it is best to extend the school year by one week.  The spring semester had previously been scheduled to end on May 29, but it will now end one week later, on June 5.  Although the additional five days of classes that have been added will not entirely make up for the eight days of classes that were cancelled, the board feels that this is the best solution and hopes sincerely that this change will not cause any serious inconvenience.</passage-text></passage>
