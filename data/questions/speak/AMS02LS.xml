I was wondering what was going to happen because, you know, we missed so many days of classes. What do you think of the decision they made?</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='woman' graphic-file='AMS02G1.jpg'>It seems like a reasonable solution, I guess, but, well, it's going to be a problem for me.</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='man' graphic-file='AMS02G1.jpg'>What kind of problem are you going to have?</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='woman' graphic-file='AMS02G1.jpg'>I've got a summer job, and I'm supposed to start the job on June 1, but now I've got to be in school until the fifth, so I won't be able to start the job on the first.</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='man' graphic-file='AMS02G1.jpg'>Can't you ask if you can start the job late?</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='woman' graphic-file='AMS02G1.jpg'>I don't know.

Now, what about you? You won't have any problem because of this change?</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='man' graphic-file='AMS02G1.jpg'>I don't think so. I don't have a job this summer; I'm going to summer school instead, and I have a class that starts on June 8.</paragraph><paragraph time='00:00:00.00' speaker='woman' graphic-file='AMS02G1.jpg'>That means you'll just lose a week of vacation.
