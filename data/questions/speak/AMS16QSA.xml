Use specific details and examples to support your response.</question-text><sample-answer-text><b>SAMPLE ANSWER</b><br/>At my university I studied engineering, and almost nothing but engineering. All the classes I took were in some way related to my major. I didn't have any art, or history, or things like that. If I had been given the choice, I would've preferred to learn a little about many subjects instead of so much about my major.<br/><br/>If I have a conversation with other engineers, I feel pretty knowledgeable about just about anything in my field. I'm <u>really</u> good at what I do, and that's great for my job. But when it comes to <u>life</u>, I don't feel prepared, and I think my school could've done a better job. What happens if I meet someone and want to discuss literature? Too bad, I can't. I have no idea about it. Or art. Or lots of other things.<br/><br/>I think the best option would be to have a combination between studying a subject or major in depth and also taking other classes outside of my major to be more well-balanced as a person. I'm interested in other subjects, but because I could study only engineering, I didn't get to learn about them. I think a student needs balance between the two.</sample-answer-text></essay>
