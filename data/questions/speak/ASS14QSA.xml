Then state which of the choices you prefer, and explain why.</question-text><sample-answer-text><b>SAMPLE ANSWER</b><br/>In this conversation, the man is talking to the woman about how many courses he should take next semester. He can take either four courses, which is a full-time schedule, or five courses, which is more than a full-time schedule. The reason that he is considering taking five courses instead of four is that he may be able to graduate early if he takes more than four classes.<br/><br/>The woman points out to him that taking five classes is more than a full-time schedule, that taking five classes is a lot of work, and it will be hard for him to do well in five classes if he's not currently doing well in four classes.<br/><br/>It also seems to me that it's not a good idea for him to take five classes if he's not doing extremely well in four classes. I think that he should try to do much better in four classes, and if he can do really well in four classes next semester, maybe after that he can consider taking five classes.</sample-answer-text></essay>
