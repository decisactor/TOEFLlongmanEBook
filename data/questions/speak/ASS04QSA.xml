<?xml version='1.0'?><essay><question-text>Some people prefer to live in the city, and some people prefer to live in the country. Which do you prefer, and why? Use reasons and examples to support your response.</question-text><sample-answer-text><b>SAMPLE ANSWER</b><br/>For me, I love the countryside. I love being out in nature, where there are trees and flowers and lakes and streams. My dream home would be in the middle of a forest, a log cabin right in the middle of a forest, and near a lake, with gorgeous views from every window of the cabin.<br/><br/>For me, however, this is not realistic. I work in a profession where the best jobs are in big cities. This means that I have to live in a city if I want to have a good job, and I do want this.<br/><br/>So, for now, this means that I must live in a big city to have the kind of job that I want, but my dream is, someday, to find a way to have a wonderful job and also live in a really natutral place.</sample-answer-text></essay>
