Include reasons and details to support your response.</question-text><sample-answer-text><b>SAMPLE ANSWER</b><br/>My favorite book is a short novel called <i>Illusions</i>. I don't remember who wrote it, but I think the original was in English. It's the story of a man who travels around to different small towns and gives people rides in an old airplane to earn his living. One day he meets another airplane pilot who is supposed to be the messiah but doesn't want the job. The two travel together and the main character learns a lot from the strange man.<br/><br/>I like this book for several reasons. The most important is the ideas that it advocates. The messiah guy says that anyone can be powerful, that we can achieve anything we want if we really want to. The novel is full of short sayings from his handbook that give very good advice on life. It's not religious at all, but it's&#8230;spiritual, I guess. After reading it, I think you'll feel like you can do anything.<br/><br/>Another reason I enjoyed the book was that it was very easy to read. I didn't need to use a dictionary often because most of the vocabulary is common. Also, it's a very short book, so I can read it pretty quickly and pick it up again when I'm bored. A friend who read it didn't like it as much as me, but I think the book is very inspirational. You should try it.</sample-answer-text></essay>
