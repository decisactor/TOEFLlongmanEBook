Which is better? Support your response with reasons and examples.</question-text><sample-answer-text><b>SAMPLE ANSWER</b><br/>Since I've lived in both situations, I can say with confidence that it's definitely better to live in a place with four seasons. Although there are times when the snow of winter or rain of spring gets boring, having four seasons is much better than having no seasons.<br/><br/>When I was in high school, I studied for one year in California, where the weather was almost always the same every day. At first I thought it was great, but later I began to miss the seasons. Winters didn't feel like winter without snow, and spring wasn't very green, like it is at home. It was like summer almost every day. It gets tiring.<br/><br/>When you have four seasons, I think you are more connected to nature. It feels like Earth is sleeping when everything is covered with snow. Everything becomes quiet and peaceful. Then in spring you feel so alive&#8212;finally you get to go outside again without a lot of clothing. The birds sing, and there are flowers everywhere. When summer starts, you really appreciate the sunshine, not like when you have it every day.<br/><br/>Of course it's nice to live in a place without seasons at least once in your life, but I can't imagine always living like that.</sample-answer-text></essay>
