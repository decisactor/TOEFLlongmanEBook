The sculptor, Borglum, began it when he was 60, and he expected to finish in five years, but the project actually took 15 years. The sculptor died before it was finished, and his son finished it.<br/><br/>The delays were caused by two types of problems. One type of problem was red tape, which is difficulty in dealing with government agencies. The other type of problem was Mother Nature, which is problems with nature. One example of a problem with nature was a crack that appeared in the carving of Thomas Jefferson's face. The sculptor had to destroy that part of the sculpture and start over again in a different place.</sample-answer-text></essay>
