The listening passage points out a problem with the suggested solution and then makes a modification to it.<br/><tab/>The reading passage indicates that the sociology department at State University has a problem in that its graduates are not being well received by employers because the department has not prepared them adequately. The faculty of the department meets and comes up with a possible solution to the problem. The solution that they suggest is to change the curriculum of the department: They have decided to increase the number of required courses from three to five and to decrease the number of elective courses from five to three, and they have decided to implement this change immediately for all students in the department.<br/><tab/>The speaker in the listening passage points out that there is one situation in which the plan will not work, though the majority of the plan will go into effect. The one issue with the plan is that current students cannot be forced to follow the plan because the university has a policy against making changes to requirements after students have started a program. Thus, the changes planned by the faculty of the Sociology Department will go into effect for newly entering students but not for students who are already in the program.</sample-answer-text></essay>
