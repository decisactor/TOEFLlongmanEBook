To deal with this problem, campus officials got together to discuss various ways to raise money, such as increasing tuition and other fees and decreasing salaries and other costs. They finally decided on several solutions; one of the solutions was to raise student parking fees from $4 per day to $8 per day, based on <exp>the assumption</exp> that this increase would enable the university to double the amount of money received from student parking fees.<br/>C.<tab/><key>The listening passage explains why <exp>this assumption</exp> was incorrect.</key>  When the plan was implemented and parking fees were doubled, many students could not pay the higher fee, so they began finding alternate ways to get to school; the students, for instance, started carpooling, walking, bicycling, or taking the bus.
