<?xml version='1.0'?><passage><passage-text>Thomas Jefferson served as secretary of state in the first administration of the fledgling United States under President George Washington. This was the period when the United States was just beginning to take shape and many people had particularly strong views about the path that the country should take. Jefferson, too, held certain opinions about what he considered best for the country.<br/>Jefferson believed overwhelmingly that the best path for the United States was to remain largely agricultural, with industry serving mainly to support agriculture. He also supported a system of free trade, believing that protective tariffs were detrimental to long-term economic growth and that removing protective tariffs would help to keep prices on imported goods low.<br/>Jefferson was also fearful of having a federal, or central, government that had too much power. He believed that, to counter the power of the federal government, it was important to invest the individual states with a considerable amount of power. In line with this, he also favored a strict interpretation of the Constitution. According to a strict interpretation of the Constitution, the federal government has only the powers that are specifically granted it in the Constitution; the federal government could not take any authority not specifically granted.<br/>Because Jefferson and his supporters favored a smaller and weaker central government with more power distributed to the states, they were known as Republicans.</passage-text></passage>
