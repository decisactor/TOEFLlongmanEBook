<?xml version='1.0'?><passage><passage-text>Considerable research has been done on how people behave in groups. Within this research, certain aspects of group behavior that have been described are (1) the deindividualization that takes place in groups and (2) the polarization that takes place in groups.<br/>Researchers have noted that, when people are working in groups, the process of deindividualization often takes place. When people are in large groups, they tend to lose their individuality and self-awareness, and they may engage in behavior within the group that they would never do individually as a result of the anonymity that they feel as a member of the group rather than as an individual. Antisocial behavior can occur in this type of situation when a normally well-behaved individual becomes part of the group and takes part in activities such as rowdiness or vandalism. The violence by fans that occurs during and after sporting events is often fueled by deindividualistic behavior by groups of fans.<br/>Another phenomenon that occurs when people get together in groups is polarization. When people who are fairly like-minded are together in a group, they tend to arrive at decisions that are far more extreme than any individual in the group might have come up with alone. One example of group polarization might be a jury of citizens who are fed up with petty crime and decides to throw the book at a criminal charged with only a minor crime. Another example of group polarization might be a town council made up of members who are fed up with littering and who pass a law mandating jail time for people who litter.</passage-text></passage>
