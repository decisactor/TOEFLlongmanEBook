<?xml version='1.0'?><passage><passage-text>How can you define history? Just what is history? You might consider saying that history is an account of everything that has happened in the past, but if you think about this definition for even a brief period of time, you will see that this is not an accurate definition of history. There have been, already, a near-infinite number of events from the past up to now, and arguably a very high percentage of all the events that have taken place have not been recorded as historical events. That is to say, not very many of the events that have occurred have been recorded.<br/>You can say, then, if you are trying to define what history is, that history involves <i>selection</i>, inasmuch as most historical events are ignored when history is recorded. Without any selection of which events to record, the incredibly high number of past events would cloud any ability to get an overall view of what has taken place.<br/>You must also recognize, if you accept the fact that the events chosen to be recorded must be selected from an almost limitless number of events, that <i>interpretation</i> is most likely involved in the selection. After all, events that are selected by historians to be recorded are most likely not selected randomly. Instead, history involves an interpretation of events, and that interpretation is based on the beliefs and assumptions of the historian who is recording the events.<br/>Thus, history is most likely not an objective account of all events that have taken place. Instead, it is a selection of events based on the interpretation of the historian recording the event.</passage-text></passage>
