<?xml version='1.0'?><passage><passage-text>The Sociology Department of State University has been receiving negative comments about its program from employers of the graduates of its department. As a result of these negative comments, the department has come to the conclusion that its graduates are not adequately prepared for jobs in their chosen profession because they are lacking expertise in certain areas.<br/>The faculty of the department considered this a very serious blow to the reputation of the department, so they began holding a series of meetings to determine the best solution to the problem. Considerable discussion of the problem and possible solutions ensued.<br/>As a result of these meetings, the faculty came to the conclusion that a change in the curriculum of the department was the best solution. Up to that point, the department required eight upper-division courses for a major in sociology, and the remaining five courses were elective courses selected from a variety of courses offered by the department. The department decided that the best solution to the problem they were discussing was to increase the number of required courses from three to five, so that a wider variety of topics could be covered in the courses required of all students, and decrease the number of elective courses from five to three, to keep the total number for the major at eight.<br/>The department announced the change in the number of required courses from three to five and also announced that this change would affect all students in the department immediately.</passage-text></passage>
