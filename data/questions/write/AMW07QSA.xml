Then, without providing a complete definition of history, the reading passage outlines two important characteristics that seem to be components of the definition. One of these is <i>selection</i>, and the other is <i>interpretation</i>. Because it is impossible to record all the events that have occurred, selection of which events to record is necessary; because events must be selected, interpretation rather than randomness is necessary in making the selection.<br/>  <tab/>The listening passage that follows the reading provides an example that supports the definition of history provided in the reading passage. In the example in the listening passage, two completely accurate but extremely different biographies were written about the same man. <tab/>One biography interpreted the man's life negatively by selecting negative events from the man's life. The other biography interpreted the man's life positively by selecting positive events from the man's life.</sample-answer-text></essay>
