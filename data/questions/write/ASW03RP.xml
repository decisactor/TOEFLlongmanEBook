<?xml version='1.0'?><passage><passage-text>Acme Accounting Company was facing a serious problem with tardiness, a problem that was beginning to have an impact on the success of the company. It had become extremely common for junior accountants to arrive late in the morning and return late again after lunch. Junior accountants had been coming late, with impunity, for so long that it was commonplace for each junior accountant to average missing one hour of work per day due to tardiness.<br/>Because the problem was so serious, the company president asked members of the senior staff to submit plans for dealing with the junior accountants' tardiness. The company president wanted to consider various plans submitted to him by his senior staff and then come to a decision about the best plan to follow.<br/>The members of the senior staff submitted plans in writing. One of the plans called for make-up time for work missed. According to this plan, if a junior accountant is an hour late arriving at work, then he or she has to stay an hour late to make up the work that he or she missed.<br/>The other plan submitted by one of the senior staff presented a different way of dealing with the problem of tardiness: this plan involved subtracting pay from the salaries of junior accountants who are late for work. According to this plan, if a junior accountant arrives at work an hour late one day, then an hour's pay is subtracted from the junior accountant's salary check.<br/>The company president wanted to consider these two plans before coming to a final decision about how to deal with the problem.</passage-text></passage>
