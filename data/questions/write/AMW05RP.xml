<?xml version='1.0'?><passage><passage-text>Dodgson College, a small private institution of higher education, received a huge bequest from one of its former students. The only stipulation on this tremendous bequest was that the money should be spent to make the college an even nicer place to study. A committee of college administrators and faculty was formed to determine the best way to put the bequest into use.<br/>At the first committee meeting, the committee quickly split into two factions, with one faction led by a representative of the administrators and the other faction led by the head of the faculty. After considerable wrangling, the two factions decided to go their separate ways to come up with separate plans for dealing with the bequest. The committee would meet in one week so that the factions could present their plans.<br/>	A week later, the committee came together, and the administrators' faction began presenting its plan for the bequest. The administrators felt that there were many worthy uses for the money. First of all, they recognized that a new classroom building was necessary because the campus did not have enough space for all the classes it wanted to offer and was turning away additional students&#8212;and much-needed additional tuition money&#8212;because of a lack of classroom space. In addition to the new classroom building, the administrators also wanted to spend part of the bequest on a new gymnasium because the gymnasium they had was more than 70 years old. Finally, the administrators wanted to spend any money remaining in the bequest on pay raises for the administration, citing the fact that administrative pay at this campus was ten percent below the national average.</passage-text></passage>
