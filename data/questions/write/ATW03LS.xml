As a teenager, Marnie loved to sing. She sang just because she enjoyed it; she really felt alive when she was singing. She sang at every possible opportunity: She belonged to the school choir, she sang at family events such as birthday parties and weddings, and she was even invited to sing at community events&#8212;the Independence Day picnic and such. She truly enjoyed every moment she was singing.<br/><br/>As Marnie grew older, she continued to sing, but she didn't always enjoy singing as much as she had in the past. Her family, school, church, and community always expected her to sing, and sometimes she really didn't feel like singing, but she had to because it was expected. Even though her audiences always applauded enthusiastically after her performances, her heart wasn't always in what she was doing.<br/><br/>One day, after a performance, a person who turned out to be a music company executive approached her and asked her if she'd ever considered singing professionally. He even offered her a recording contract that would give her more money than she'd ever dreamed of having. She knew she should sign the contract because the money that was offered was a really incredible amount. Even though she didn't enjoy singing anywhere near as much as she had when she was younger, she knew that the responsible decision was to sign the contract so that she would be taken care of financially. She signed the contract.</paragraph></page></script>
