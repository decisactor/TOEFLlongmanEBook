<?xml version='1.0'?><passage><passage-text>Woods University had a big problem, and the problem had to do with the budget. Because the university had not been given a big enough budget to operate in the way that it was used to operating for the coming year, campus officials were looking for ways to raise additional funds to supplement the budget that they had been given. Campus officials came together and discussed, in a rather heated manner, a number of ways that they could raise much-needed additional funds, such as raising tuition and campus fees or decreasing salaries (a plan that was quickly nixed) and various other costs. Officials finally came out with a number of plans to implement.<br/>	One of the plans that they decided to put into effect immediately was an increase in daily parking fees for students (but not for faculty members or administrators). They decided to increase the four-dollar daily fee for student parking to eight dollars per day. Because they were doubling the fee, it seemed easy to draw the conclusion that the fees that the university received from student parking could be doubled. Within a week, the plan had been officially announced, and it was put into effect. Campus officials waited expectantly for the doubled parking fees to begin to mount up.</passage-text></passage>
