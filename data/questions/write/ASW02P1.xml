<?xml version='1.0'?><essay><question-text>How does this information on Hamilton compare to the information in the reading passage on Jefferson?</question-text><sample-answer-text>A.<tab/>In this set of materials, <exp>the reading <key>passage discusses</key></exp> Thomas Jefferson, who served as secretary of state in the first government of the United States, while <exp>the listening passage discusses</exp> Alexander Hamilton, who was the secretary of the treasury in the same government. Because the United States was a very young country at the time, people working in the government were trying to figure out what kind of country it should be. Jefferson and Hamilton differed considerably in their ideas of what the country should be like.<br/>B.<tab/>One way that Jefferson and Hamilton disagreed was as to what the basis of the economy should be. Jefferson believed that the mainstay of the economy should be agriculture; Hamilton, however, believed that the economy should be based on manufacturing. In a related idea, Jefferson believed that there should not be any tariffs on imported manufactured goods to protect domestic manufacturing.<br/>C.<tab/>Another way that Jefferson and Hamilton disagreed was on the power-sharing relationship between the states and the federal government. Jefferson, a Republican, believed that the states should have more power than the central government and therefore believed in a strict interpretation of the Constitution, which gave more power to the states. Federalist Hamilton, on the other hand, believed the opposite, that the federal government should have more power than the states and that the Constitution should be broadly interpreted, an interpretation that would give more power to the federal government.</sample-answer-text></essay>
