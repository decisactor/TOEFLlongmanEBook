<?xml version='1.0'?><passage><passage-text>A newspaper in a college community was interested in offering a scholarship to a deserving student attending the local college, and a committee was appointed to select a recipient for this award. The committee worked diligently to determine the best criteria for selecting someone to receive the scholarship. After much consideration, the committee finally arrived at a consensus on the characteristics that a worthy recipient should possess.<br/>First of all, the committee members believed that a student worthy of the award should be majoring in journalism. They furthermore believed that the student's grades were important, particularly those in journalism. The committee felt that a major in journalism was essential for someone receiving a scholarship from a newspaper and that high grades, particularly in journalism, indicated a strong commitment to getting a good education.<br/>In addition, the committee also believed that, in addition to having a journalism major and high grades, particularly in journalism, a worthy recipient should be well-rounded. This means that he or she should be involved in a wide variety of activities. The committee wanted to select a student who had wide and varied interests and who was committed enough to be actively involved in these interests.<br/>A final characteristic that the committee believed a worthy recipient should possess was service to the community. The recipient should be involved in the community and should have taken steps to help improve the lives of people living in the community. The committee wanted to select a student who was interested in more than simply making life better for himself or herself.</passage-text></passage>
