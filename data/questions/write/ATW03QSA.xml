The listening passage provides an example of these types of motivation.<br/><tab/>In the reading passage, motivation is defined as the total of the wants and needs that make someone take action. Extrinsic motivation is motivation that comes from outside a person. It can be tangible, such as money or goods, or intangible, perhaps praise, or approval, or attention. The overjustification effect is an effect that is related to these two types of motivation: This effect is the decrease in intrinsic motivation that occurs when extrinsic rewards are given to someone who is intrinsically motivated to act.<br/><tab/>The listening passage provides an example of these types of motivation in the life of a singer, Marnie. When Marnie was young, she was intrinsically motivated to sing; she sang simply because singing gave her pleasure. As Marnie grew up, her motivation for singing became more extrinsic; she sang because others expected her to sing and then, after becoming a professional singer, sang for money. As she got more and more extrinsic motivation for singing, the overjustification effect occurred as her intrinsic motivation, her pleasure in singing, diminished considerably.</sample-answer-text></essay>
