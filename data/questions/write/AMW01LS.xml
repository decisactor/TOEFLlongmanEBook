I've just been reminded that State University has a policy that rule changes take effect as students are entering a program; rules cannot be changed for students who are already partway through a program. Since this is a university-wide policy, it countermands any decision that this department might make.<br/><br/>When we changed the requirements of the Sociology Department by adding two more required courses, students who were already in the department complained to the university. Because it is a university policy that rule changes can take effect only as students enter a program, the university decided that students who were already partway through their sociology programs could not be forced to follow the new requirements. University policy mandates that the new requirements can take effect only with students who are newly entering the Sociology Department and not with students who have already started the program.<br/><br/>The end result is that students who have already started their sociology program cannot be forced to follow the new requirements; they can graduate from this department with the three required courses and the five electives instead of the five required courses and three electives. And because the department can't force current students to take the two additional required courses, all we can do is make a strong recommendation to current students to take the courses instead of requiring them to do it. The new requirements will go into effect immediately for new students entering the department.</paragraph></page></script>
