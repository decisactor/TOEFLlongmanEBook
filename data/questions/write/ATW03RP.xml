<?xml version='1.0'?><passage><passage-text>Motivation, in simple terms, is the sum of the needs and wants that cause a person to act. There are many ways that motives can be classified, but one such way is whether motives are <i>extrinsic</i> or <i>intrinsic</i> in nature.<br/>Extrinsic motivation is a drive to perform an activity in order to obtain a reward from outside the individual. Examples of extrinsic motives are money or any other goods and services that money can buy, as well as externally bestowed intangible rewards such as attention, approval, praise, or applause.<br/><i>Intrinsic</i> motivation is a desire to perform an activity for its own sake rather than for an external reward. If a person is intrinsically motivated, he or she might be motivated, for example, by a desire for satisfaction, personal pleasure, self-fulfillment, creativity, or accomplishment. Those who are motivated intrinsically tend to be happier and psychologically healthier than are those who are extrinsically motivated.<br/>It is quite possible for someone to be offered extrinsic rewards for doing something that he or she is already intrinsically motivated to do. When someone is given an extrinsic reward for doing something that is already intrinsically rewarding, then it is quite possible for that person's intrinsic motivation to diminish. This decrease in intrinsic motivation is called the overjustification effect. To restate, the overjustification effect is the decrease in intrinsic motivation that occurs as a result of the addition of extrinsic rewards for an activity that had previously occurred as a result of only intrinsic motivation.</passage-text></passage>
