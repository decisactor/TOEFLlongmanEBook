<?xml version='1.0'?><essay audio-file='ATW01Q1.mp3'><question-text>What conclusion can be drawn from the information presented in the reading passage and the information presented in the listening passage?</question-text><sample-answer-text><tab/>The reading passage in this set of materials describes a scholarship that a newspaper wants to award to a student from the local college and goes on to outline the main criteria for selecting a scholarship winner. The listening passage then describes the two finalists for the scholarship.<br/><tab/>The scholarship committee decided to base the decision about the winner of the scholarship on three main criteria: (1) They wanted the winner to be a good student majoring in journalism. (2) They also wanted the winner to be involved in a wide variety of campus activities. (3) Finally, they wanted someone who was involved in service to the community.<br/><tab/>The listening passage indicates that there are two finalists for the scholarship. Becky Stevens is majoring in journalism, and she gets grades of A's and B's; she is involved in the student council, the soccer team, the orchestra, and the photography club on campus; she volunteers at a hospital and a home for the elderly. Ralph Meyers is majoring in biology, and he gets straight A's; he spends his time on campus only in the research lab; he is not involved in service to the community.<br/><tab/>If one applies the criteria of the selection committee to the two candidates, a fairly strong conclusion can be drawn. Ralph Meyers is clearly an excellent student who is worthy of considerable admiration; however, Becky Stevens seems to fit the committee's criteria better than Ralph Meyers does because of her major in journalism, her wide variety of campus activities, and her service to the community.</sample-answer-text></essay>
