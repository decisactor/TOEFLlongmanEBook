<paragraph time='00:00:04' speaker='student' graphic-file='ATL02G2.jpg'>Hello, Dr. Hart, do you have a moment? I'd like to ask you a question if I could.</paragraph>
<paragraph   speaker='professor' graphic-file='ATL02G2.jpg'>Now's just fine. What's your question?</paragraph>
<paragraph   speaker='student' graphic-file='ATL02G2.jpg'>Well, I didn't do very well on the last exam, the one on the structure of the Earth.</paragraph>
<paragraph   speaker='professor' graphic-file='ATL02G2.jpg'>Do you have your exam paper with you? Let me see what you did&#8230;Um&#8230;You've got a lot of things confused here.</paragraph>
<paragraph   speaker='student' graphic-file='ATL02G2.jpg'>I do?</paragraph> 
<paragraph   speaker='professor' graphic-file='ATL02G2.jpg'>Yes,&#8230;for example, here you said that the Earth's crust under landmasses is thin and the crust under the oceans is thick. That's not right; it's the opposite.</paragraph>
<paragraph   speaker='student' graphic-file='ATL02G2.jpg'>You mean, the crust is thick under landmasses and thin under the oceans?</paragraph> 
<paragraph   speaker='professor' graphic-file='ATL02G2.jpg'>That's right.</paragraph>
<paragraph   speaker='student' graphic-file='ATL02G2.jpg'>I knew it was one or the other&#8230;.</paragraph> 
<paragraph   speaker='professor' graphic-file='ATL02G2.jpg'>Now, look what you said about the Earth's mantle. You said that the mantle is only a small part of the crust, but that's also not true.</paragraph>
<paragraph   speaker='student' graphic-file='ATL02G2.jpg'>It's a large part of the crust?</paragraph> 
<paragraph   speaker='professor' graphic-file='ATL02G2.jpg'>(<i>sighs</i>) Yes, the mantle makes up the greatest part of the crust.</paragraph>
<paragraph   speaker='student' graphic-file='ATL02G2.jpg'>I can see why I didn't get very many points on that answer&#8230;.</paragraph> 
<paragraph   speaker='professor' graphic-file='ATL02G2.jpg'>Uh&#8230;and here, look what you said about the core, you said the core has three parts, the outer core, the middle core, and the inner core.</paragraph>
<paragraph   speaker='student' graphic-file='ATL02G2.jpg'>And that's not correct, either?</paragraph> 
<paragraph   speaker='professor' graphic-file='ATL02G2.jpg'>No, it's not. There aren't <u>three</u> parts to the core; there are only two, the outer core and the inner core.</paragraph>
<paragraph   speaker='student' graphic-file='ATL02G2.jpg'>There's no middle core?</paragraph> 
<paragraph   speaker='professor' graphic-file='ATL02G2.jpg'>No, only the outer core and the inner core, as I said.</paragraph>
<paragraph   speaker='student' graphic-file='ATL02G2.jpg'>OK, I understand&#8230;.</paragraph> 
<paragraph   speaker='professor' graphic-file='ATL02G2.jpg'>And look here, you got this wrong, too. You said that the inner core was liquid and the outer core was not.</paragraph>
<paragraph   speaker='student' graphic-file='ATL02G2.jpg'>Is that backwards, too?</paragraph> 
<paragraph   speaker='professor' graphic-file='ATL02G2.jpg'>Yes, that's backwards, too.</paragraph>
<paragraph   speaker='student' graphic-file='ATL02G2.jpg'>So the outer core is liquid, and the inner core isn't liquid?</paragraph> 
<paragraph   speaker='professor' graphic-file='ATL02G2.jpg'>That's right. <b>Now, <exp>I think you can see why your grade wasn't very high. <u>In fact, I'm not even sure you deserve the score you got.</u> You'll need to do much better on the next exam</exp>.</b></paragraph>
<paragraph   speaker='student' graphic-file='ATL02G2.jpg'>I'll try.</paragraph> 
<paragraph   speaker='professor' graphic-file='ATL02G2.jpg'>You do that.</paragraph>
<paragraph   speaker='student' graphic-file='ATL02G2.jpg'>It shouldn't be too hard to do better. In fact, it would probably be difficult to do much worse.</paragraph> 
<paragraph   speaker='professor' graphic-file='ATL02G2.jpg'>You won't get an argument from me on that!</paragraph>
