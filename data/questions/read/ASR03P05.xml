            Parasitic plants are plants that survive by using food produced by host plants rather
        than by producing their own food from the Sun's energy. Because they do not need sunlight
        to survive, parasitic plants are generally found in umbrageous areas rather than in areas
        exposed to direct sunlight. Parasitic plants attach themselves to host plants, often to the
        stems or roots, by means of haustoria, which the parasite uses to make its way into the
        food channels of the host plant and absorb the nutrients that it needs to survive from the
        host plant.

            The world's heaviest flower, a species of rafflesia, is a parasite that flourishes among,
        and lives off of, the roots of jungle vines. Each of these ponderous blooms can weigh up to
        15 pounds (7 kg) and can measure up to 3 feet (1 m) <bg>across</bg>.
