            <b>Tiger Moths</b>
        </div>
        <br/>
            One of the most beautiful of the more than 100,000 known species in the order
        <i>Lepidoptera</i> are the tiger moths, moths known for the striking appeal of their distinctive
        coloration. This type of moth is covered with highly conspicuous orange-and-black or
        yellow-and-black patterns of spots and stripes. Such boldly patterned color combinations
        are commonplace in the animal world, serving the function of forewarning potential
        predators of unpleasant tastes and smells. This is unquestionably the function served by
        the striking coloration of the garden tiger moth, which is quite visually attractive but is also
        poisonous to predators. Certain glands in the garden tiger moth produce strong toxins
        that circulate throughout the insect's bloodstream, while other glands secrete bubbles that
        produce a noxious warning smell. The tiger moth, indeed, is a clear example of a concept
        that many predators intuitively understand, that creatures with the brightest coloration are
        often the least suitable to eat.
