            Autism is a developmental disorder that is characterized by severe behavioral
        abnormalities across all primary areas of functioning. Its <bg>onset</bg> is often early; it generally
        makes itself known by the age of two and one-half. It is not a single disease entity but
        is instead a syndrome defined by patterns and characteristics of behavior; it, therefore,
        most likely has multiple etiologies rather than a single causative factor. Autism is not fully
        understood and thus is controversial with respect to diagnosis, etiology, and treatment
        strategies.
