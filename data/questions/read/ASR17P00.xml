        <br/>
            Crescent-shaped Lake Baikal, in Siberia, is only the ninth largest lake in area at 385
        miles (620 km) in length and 46 miles (7 4 km) in width, yet it is easily the largest body of
        fresh water in the world. It holds one-fifth of the world's total fresh water, which is more than
        the total of all the water in the five Great Lakes; it holds so much fresh water in spite of its
        less-than-impressive area because it is by far the world's deepest lake. The average depth
        of the lake is 1,312 feet (400 meters) below sea level, and the Olkhon Crevice, the lowest
        known point, is more than 5,250 feet (1,600 meters) deep.
        <br/>
            Lake Baikal, which today is located near the center of the Asian peninsula, is most
        likely the world's oldest lake. It began forming 25 million years ago as Asia started splitting
        apart in a series of great faults. The Baikal Valley dropped away, eventually filling with water
        and creating the deepest of the world's lakes.
