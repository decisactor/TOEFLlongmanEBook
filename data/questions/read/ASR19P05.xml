            <b>The Clovis Culture</b>
        </div>
        <br/>
            Archeologists have found sites all over North America that contain similar tools dating
        from a period about 12,000 years ago. The culture that developed these tools has been
        named Clovis after the site near Clovis, New Mexico, where the first tools of this sort were
        discovered in 1932. The tools are quite sophisticated and are unlike any tools that have
        been found in the Old World.
        <br/>
            In the years since the first tools of this sort were discovered in New Mexico,
        archeologists have discovered Clovis tools in areas ranging from Mexico to Montana in the
        United States and Nova Scotia in Canada. All of the Clovis finds date from approximately
        the same period, a fact which suggests that the Clovis spread rapidly throughout the North
        American continent.
        <br/>
            From the evidence that has been discovered, archeologists have concluded that the
        Clovis were a mobile culture. They traveled in groups of 40 to 50 individuals, migrating
        seasonally and returning to the same hunting camps each year. Their population increased
        rapidly as they spread out over the continent, and they were quite possibly motivated to
        develop their sophisticated hunting tools to feed their rapidly expanding populace.
