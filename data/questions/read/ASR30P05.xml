            <b>Demographic Change</b>
        </div>
        <br/>
            By the end of the 1920s, American society had undergone a long and historic
        demographic change. Since the 1870s, the country had been moving from a more rural
        mode that was based on high birthrates&#8211;as high as 50 births annually per thousand people
        in the early nineteenth century&#8211;to a more metropolitan mode. Prior to the 1870s, the
        population of the country was increasing by about a third every decade; however, by the
        end of the 1920s, a radical about-face had taken place.
        <br/> 
            One major factor to affect the demographics of the country during this period was a
        dramatic decrease in birthrates. T he trend during this era was more pronounced in urban
        areas but also had an effect in rural areas. As a result of the trend toward smaller families,
        particularly in cities, the birthrate was down to 27.7 births annually per thousand women
        by 1920 and had dropped even further&#8211;to 21.3 births annually per thousand women&#8211;by
        1930.
        <br/> 
            At the same time, the deathrate, too, was falling. Urban living led to better sanitation,
        refrigeration, and water purification; it also resulted in better medical care as doctors and
        hospitals were more readily available. <bg>Most likely</bg> as a result of these factors, there were
        only eleven deaths per thousand annually by the early 1920s, which was half the rate of the
        1880s.
