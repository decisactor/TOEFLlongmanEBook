            <b>Lions</b>
        </div>
        <br/> 
            Something unusual about lions is that they hunt in groups. Group hunting is
        beneficial to lions because it means that much larger prey can be captured by the lions. It
        also means that individual lions expend much less energy during a hunt.
        <br/>
            There is a standard pattern to the process of hunting in groups. The process is
        initiated by a single female, who stations herself at a raised elevation to serve as a lookout
        to spot potential prey. When prey is spotted, a group of young lionesses advances on
        the herd and pushes the herd in the direction of a different lioness who has hidden herself
        downwind. It is up to this concealed female to choose the weakest member of the herd
        for the kill. 
        <br/>
            <sqr/> As can be seen from this description of the process, it is the females rather than
        the male or males in the pride that take part in the kill. <sqr/> The younger and stronger females
        are the ones who go on the attack. <sqr/> While the females are on the attack, the males stay
        behind to protect the rest of the pride from attack by predators such as hyenas. <sqr/>
