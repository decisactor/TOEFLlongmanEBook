            <b>Island Plant Life</b>
        </div>
        <br/>
            Islands are geographical formations that are completely surrounded by water, yet
        many islands are covered with a rich assortment of plant life. It may seem surprising that
        so much plant life exists on many islands, yet there are surprisingly simple explanations as
        to how the vegetation has been able to establish itself there. Some islands were formerly
        attached to larger bodies of land, while others were created on their own. Islands that were
        created when flooding or rising water levels cut them off from their neighbors often still have
        the plant life that they had before they were cut off. In cases where islands formed out of
        the ocean, they may have plant life from neighboring lands even though they were never
        actually attached to the neighboring lands. Winds carry many seeds to islands; some plants
        produce extremely light seeds that can float thousands of feet above the Earth and then
        drift down to islands where they can sprout and develop. Birds also carry seeds to islands;
        as birds move over open stretches of water, they can serve as the transportation system to
        spread seeds from place to place.
