            <b>Territoriality</b>
        </div>
        <br/>
            In many species, members of the species exhibit aggressive behavior toward one
        another, often with a focus on territoriality, the fight for exclusive control of a particular area.
        The level of violence in territorial aggression varies widely from species to species, though
        few species fight other members of the species to death and instead rely on non-lethal
        contests for control of territory that involves noise-making maneuvers such as roaring or
        hissing or aggressive posturing or gestures.
        <br/>
            Most bird species are known to be territorial to some degree, though the territorial
        behaviors exhibited by most species are limited to singing contests, which can go on for
        days, or threatening postures with wings lifted or extended. The swan, on the other hand, is
        quite unlike other birds in this respect. The swan may seem particularly elegant and serene
        as it glides across the surface of a lake; however, male swans are, in reality, quite territorial
        and will fight other male swans for the exclusive use of a lake no matter how large the lake
        is. Males will engage in ferocious contests , with <bg>their necks entwined</bg> as they attempt to
        cause mortal injury to each other.
