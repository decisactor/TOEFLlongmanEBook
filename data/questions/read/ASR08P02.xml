        <br/>
            Horatio Alger, Jr. (1832-1899) was the author of more than 100 books for boys in
        the second half of the nineteenth century that focused on the theme of success coming
        to those who work hard to achieve <bg>it</bg>. The son of a minister, Alger came from a prominent
        Massachusetts family. He graduated with honors from Harvard in 1852 and graduated from
        the Cambridge Divinity School eight years later. He served as a minister for a short time before
        moving to New York City in 1866 to devote his time to writing inspirational books for boys.
        <br/>
            In many of his books, he wrote about the poor and homeless children of the slums
        of New York City, seeing them as unfortunate pawns of society who, if only given the
        opportunity, could improve their lot. A general plotline that he followed often was of a poor
        boy who managed to achieve a respectable and successful life by working hard and taking
        advantage of opportunities presented. Though his writing style was characterized by simplicity
        and repetition, it was well received by his target audience; his books were enormously
        popular, selling millions of copies well into the first few decades of the twentieth century.
