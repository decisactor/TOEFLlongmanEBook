            <b>The Cambrian Explosion</b>
        </div>
        <br/>
            Many of the major phyla of animals arose during the Cambrian period, in what is called
        the Cambrian Explosion. Prior to the Cambrian period, simple one-celled organisms had
        slowly evolved into primitive multicellular creatures. Then, in a relatively rapid explosion
        during the period from 540 million years ago to 500 million years ago, there was a period of
        astonishing diversification in which quickly developing organisms became widely distributed
        and formed complex communities.
        <br/> 
            One theoretical explanation for the rapid diversification that occurred during the
        Cambrian period is known as the theory of polar wander. According to this theory, the rapid
        diversification occurred because of an unusually rapid reorganization of the Earth's crust
        during the Cambrian period. This rapid change in the Earth's crust initiated evolutionary
        change inasmuch as change in the environment serves to trigger evolutionary change.
