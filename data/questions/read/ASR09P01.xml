        	Camouflage is one of the most effective ways for animals to avoid attack in the
        treeless Arctic. <bg>However, the summer and winter landscapes there. are so diverse that a
        single protective coloring scheme would, of course, prove ineffective. in one season or the
        other.</bg> Thus, many of the inhabitants of the Arctic tundra change their camouflage twice
        a year. The arctic fox is a clear-cut example of this phenomenon; it sports a brownish-,
        gray coat in the summer which then turns white as cold weather sets in, and the process
        reverse itself in the springtime. Its brownish-gray coat blends in with the barren tundra
        landscape in the months without snow, and the white coat naturally blends in with the
        landscape of the frozen wintertime tundra.
