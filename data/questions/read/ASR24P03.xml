            <b>Dissociative Identity Disorder</b>
        </div>
        <br/>
            Dissociative identity disorder is a psychological condition in which a person's identity
        dissociates, or fragments, thereby creating distinct independent identities within one
        individual. Each separate personality can be distinct from the other personalities in a number
        of ways, including posture, manner of moving, tone and pitch of voice, gestures, facial
        expressions, and use of language. A person suffering from dissociative identity disorder may
        have a large number of independent personalities or perhaps only two or three.
        <br/> 
            Two stories of actual women suffering from dissociative identity disorder have been
        extensively recounted in books and films that are familiar to the public. One of them is
        the story of a woman with 22 separate personalities known as Eve. In the 1950s, a book
        by Corbett Thigpen and a motion picture starring Joanne Woodward, each of which was
        titled The <i>Three Faces of Eve</i>, presented her story; the title referred to 3 faces, when the
        woman known as Eve actually experienced 22 different personalities, because only 3 of
        the personalities could exist at one time. Two decades later, Carolyn Sizemore, Eve's 22nd
        personality, wrote about her experiences in a book entitled <i>I'm Eve</i>. The second wellknown
        story of a woman suffering from dissociative personality disorder is the story of
        Sybil, a woman whose 16 distinct personalities emerged over a period of 40 years. A book
        describing Sybil's experiences was written by Flora Rheta Schreiber and was published in
        1973; a motion picture based on the book and starring Sally Field followed.
