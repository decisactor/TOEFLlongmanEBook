            <b>Accidental Inventions</b>
        </div>
        <br/>
            A number of products that we commonly use today were developed quite by accident.
        Two of many possible examples of this concept are the leotard and the Popsicle, each of
        which came about when an insightful person recognized a potential benefit in a negative
        situation.
        <br/>
            The first of these accidental inventions is the leotard, a close-fitting, one-piece
        garment worn today by dancers, gymnasts, and acrobats, among others. In 1828,
        a circus performer named Nelson Hower was faced with the prospect of missing his
        performance because his costume was at the cleaners. Instead of canceling his part of
        the show, he decided to perform in his long underwear. Soon, other circus performers
        began performing the same way. When popular acrobat Jules Leotard adopted the style,
        it became known as the leotard.

            Another product invented by chance was the Popsicle. In 1905, eleven-year-old
        Frank Epperson stirred up a drink of fruit-flavored powder and soda water and then
        mistakenly left the drink, with the spoon in it, out on the back porch overnight. As the
        temperature dropped that night, the soda water froze around the spoon, creating a tasty
        treat. Years later, remembering how enjoyable the treat had been, Epperson went into
        business producing Popsicles.
