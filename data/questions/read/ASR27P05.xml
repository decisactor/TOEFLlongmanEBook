            <b>The Golden Age of Comics</b>
        </div>
        <br/>
            The period from the late 1930s to the middle 1940s is known as the Golden Age of
        comic books. The modern comic book came about in the early 1930s in the United States
        as a giveaway premium to promote the sales of a whole range of household products such
        as cereal and cleansers. The comic books, which were printed in bright colors to attract
        the attention of potential customers, proved so popular that some publishers decided to
        produce comic books that would come out on a monthly basis and would sell for a dime
        each. Though comic strips had been reproduced in publications prior to this time, the
        <i>Famous Funnies</i> comic book, which was started in 1934, marked the first occasion that a
        serialized book of comics was attempted.

            Early comic books reprinted already existing comic strips and comics based on known
        characters; however, publishers soon began introducing original characters developed
        specifically for comic books. Superman was introduced in <i>Action Comics</i> in 1938, and
        Batman was introduced a year later. The tremendous success of these superhero comic
        books led to the development of numerous comic books on a variety of topics, though
        superhero comic books predominated. Astonishingly, by 1945 approximately 160 different
        comic books were being published in the United States each month, and 90 percent of U.S.
        children were said to read comic books on a regular basis.
