        <br/>
            Members of the flatfish family, sand dabs and flounders, have an evolutionary
        advantage over many colorfully decorated ocean neighbors in that they are able to
        adapt their body coloration to different environments . These aquatic chameleons have
        flattened bodies that are well-suited to life along the ocean floor in the shallower areas of
        the continental shelf that they inhabit. They also have remarkably sensitive color vision
        that registers the subtlest gradations on the sea bottom and in the sea life around them.
        Information about the coloration of the environment is carried through the nervous system
        to chromatophores, which are pigment-carrying skin cells. These chromatophores are able
        to accurately reproduce not only the colors but also the texture of the ocean floor. Each time
        that a sand dab or flounder finds itself in a new environment, the pattern on the body of the
        fish adapts to fit in with the color and texture around it.
