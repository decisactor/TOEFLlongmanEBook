            <b>Uranium</b>
        </div>
        <br/>
            Uranium, a radioactive metal named after the planet Uranus, is a primary source of
        energy in nuclear power plants and certain nuclear weapons. It occurs naturally in three
        different isotopes, which differ in their facility in undergoing nuclear fission.
        <br/> 
            <sqr/> The three naturally occurring isotopes of uranium are U-234, U-235, and U-238. <sqr/> 
        Each of these isotopes has the same atomic number of 92, which is the number of protons
        in the nucleus. <sqr/> However, each has a different number of neutrons and thus has a different
        atomic mass , which is the sum of the number of protons and neutrons. <sqr/>
        <br/>
            Of these three naturally occurring isotopes of uranium, U-238 is by far the most
        common, while U-235 is the most capable of undergoing nuclear fission. More than 99
        percent of all naturally occurring uranium is U-238, while U-234 and U-235 each makes
        up less than 1 percent. Nuclear fission can occur when a U-235 nucleus is struck by a
        neutron, and the nucleus splits, releasing energy and releasing two or more neutrons.
        However, nuclear fission rarely involves a U-238 or a U-234 nucleus because it is unusual
        for either of these nuclei to break apart when struck by a neutron.
