        <br/>
            Most chromium compounds have brightly colored hues, and as a result they are widely
        used as coloring agents, or pigments, in paints. In addition to having a pleasing color, a paint
        must protect the surface to which it is applied and be easy to apply in a thin, uniform coat.
        <br/>
            All paints consist of two parts. One is a powder of solid particles that is the source of
        the color and the opaqueness and is known as the pigment. The other, called the binder, is
        the liquid into which the pigment is blended. The binder used in some paints is made from
        oily solvents such as those derived from petroleum resources. When applied, these solvents
        evaporate, leaving deposits of pigment on the surface.
