        	One method of popping corn involved skewering an ear of corn on a stick and
        roasting it until the kernels popped off the ear. Corn was also popped by first cutting the
        kernels off the cob, throwing them into a fire, and gathering them as they popped out of the
        fire. In a final method for popping corn, sand and unpopped kernels of corn were mixed
        together in a cooking pot and heated until the corn popped to the surface of the sand in the
        pot.

        	<sqr/> This traditional Native American dish was quite a novelty to newcomers to the
        Americas. <sqr/> Columbus and his sailors found natives in the West Indies wearing popcorn
        necklaces, and explorer Hernando Cortes described the use of popcorn amulets in
        the religious ceremonies of the Aztecs. <sqr/> According to legendary descriptions of the
        celebratory meal, Quadequina, the brother of Chief Massasoit, contributed several deerskin
        bags of popcorn to the celebration. <sqr/>
