            <b>The Postage Stamp</b>
        </div>
        <br/>
            The postage stamp has been around for only a relatively short period of time. The
        use of stamps for postage was first proposed in England in 1837, when Sir Rowland Hill
        published a pamphlet entitled "Post Office Reform: Its Importance and Practicability" to
        put forth the ideas that postal rates should not be based on the distance that a letter or
        package travels but should instead be based on the weight of the letter or package and
        that fees for postal services should be collected in advance of the delivery, rather than after,
        through the use of postage stamps.
        <br/>
            The ideas proposed by Hill went into effect in England almost immediately, and other
        countries soon followed suit. The first English stamp, which featured a portrait of then
        Queen Victoria, was printed in 1840. This stamp, the "penny black," came in sheets that
        needed to be separated with scissors and provided enough postage for a letter weighing
        14 grams or less to any destination. In 1843, Brazil was the next nation to produce national
        postage stamps, and various areas in what is today Switzerland also produced postage
        stamps later in the same year. Postage stamps in five- and ten-cent denominations were
        first approved by the U.S. Congress in 184 7, and by 1860 postage stamps were being
        issued in more than 90 governmental jurisdictions worldwide.
