            <b>Smog</b>
        </div>
        <br/>   
            The oxidation of exhaust gases is one of the primary sources of the world's pollution.
        The brown haze that is poised over some of the world's largest cities is properly called
        <i>photochemical smog<i/>; it results from chemical reactions that <bg>take place</bg> in the air, using the
        energy of sunlight. The production of smog begins when gases are created in the cylinders
        of vehicle engines. It is there that oxygen and nitrogen gas combine as the fuel burns to
        form nitric oxide (NO), a colorless gas. The nitric oxide is forced out into the air through the
        vehicle tailpipe along with other gases.
        <br/>
            When the gas reaches the air, it comes into contact with available oxygen from the
        atmosphere and combines with the oxygen to produce nitrogen dioxide (N02), which is a
        gas with a brownish hue. This nitrogen dioxide plays a role in the formation of acid rain in
        wetter or more humid climates and tends to decompose back into nitric oxide as it releases
        an oxygen atom from each molecule; the released oxygen atoms quickly combine with
        oxygen (02) molecules to form ozone (03). The brownish colored nitrogen dioxide is partially
        responsible for the brown color in smoggy air; the ozone is the toxic substance that causes
        irritation to eyes.
