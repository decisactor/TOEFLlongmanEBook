            <b>A Surprising Connection</b>
        </div>
        <br/>
            It can be quite surprising to understand that the words <i>buckaroo</i> and <i>vaccine</i>
        are actually derived from the same source inasmuch as a buckaroo is a casual way of
        identifying a cowboy and a vaccine is a substance that can be used to prevent disease.
        <br/>
            The word <i>buckaroo</i> might not be easily recognizable at first as a borrowing into English
        of the Spanish word <i>vaquero</i>, which in Spanish refers to a cowboy. The initial letter <i>v</i> in
        Spanish is pronounced with two lips rather than the pronunciation with the upper front
        teeth and lower lip of an English <i>v</i> and can sound more like the letter <i>b</i> than the letter <i>v</i> to
        an English speaker; thus, the English variation of the Spanish word begins with a <i>b</i> rather
        than a <i>v</i>. The English word also begins with the syllable <i>buck</i>, which is somewhat similar in
        sound to the first syllable of the Spanish word and is also an easily identifiable word itself in
        English.
        <br/>
            The Spanish word <i>vaquero</i> comes from vacca, the Latin word for "cow." Another
        word from the same Latin source is <i>vaccine</i>. In the late eighteenth century, the English
        physician Edward Jenner discovered that inoculation with a form of cowpox was effective in
        preventing the dreaded disease smallpox. French chemist Louis Pasteur, who was himself
        experimenting with a number of varieties of inoculation, used the word <i>vaccination</i> for
        preventative inoculation in general and the word <i>vaccine</i> for the substance inoculated in
        honor of Jenner's earlier contribution to the development of vaccines.
