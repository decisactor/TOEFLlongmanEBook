            <b>The Bald Eagle</b>
        </div>
        <br/>
            When the bald eagle became the national symbol of the United States in 1782, soon
        after the country was born, it is estimated that there were as many as 75,000 nesting pairs
        in North America. By the early 1960s, however, the number of nesting pairs had been
        reduced to only around 450.
        <br/>
            The demise of the bald eagle is generally attributed to the effects of the pesticide
        DDT (dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane). This pesticide was used to kill insects harmful to
        agriculture, thereby increasing agricultural production. One unintended negative result of
        the use of DDT was that, while it did get rid of the undesirable insects, it also made its way
        along the food chain into fish, a favorite food source of the bald eagle.
        <br/>
            The bald eagle is now protected by federal laws. It was originally protected by the
        Bald Eagle Act of 1940 and later by the Endangered Species Act of 1973. However, it is not
        just the laws directly related to endangered species that aided in the resurgence of the bald
        eagle; its resurgence has also been widely attributed to the banning of DDT in 1972. Today
        there are more than 5,000 pairs of bald eagles, a tenfold increase over the low point of 450,
        and the bird was removed from the list of endangered species in July, 1999.
