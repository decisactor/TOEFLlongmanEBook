            <b>New World Epidemics</b>
        </div>
        <br/>
            A huge loss of life resulted from the introduction of Old World diseases into the
        Americas in the early sixteenth century. The inhabitants of the Americas were separated
        from Asia, Africa, and Europe by rising oceans following the Ice Ages, and, as a result, they
        were isolated by means of this watery barrier from numerous virulent epidemic diseases
        that had developed across the ocean, such as measles, smallpox, pneumonia, and malaria.
        Pre-Columbian Americans had a relatively disease-free environment but also lacked
        the antibodies needed to protect the'm from bacteria and viruses brought to America by
        European explorers and colonists. A devastating outbreak of disease that strikes for the first
        time against a completely unprotected population is known as a virgin soil epidemic. Virgin
        soil epidemics contributed to an unbelievable decline in the population of native inhabitants
        of the Americas, <bg>one</bg> that has been estimated at as much as an 80 percent decrease of the
        native population in the centuries following the arrival of Europeans in the Americas.
