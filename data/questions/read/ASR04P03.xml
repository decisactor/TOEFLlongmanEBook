            <b>Edna Ferber</b>
        </div>
        <br/>
            Edna Ferber (1887-1968) was a popular American novelist in the first half of the twentieth century. 
        She embarked on her career by working as a newspaper reporter in
        Wisconsin and soon began writing novels. Her first novel, <i>Dawn O'Hara, the Girl Who
        Laughed,</i> was published in 1911, when she was only twenty-four years old.
        <br/>
            Her big break came with the novel So <i>Big</i> (1924), which was awarded the Pulitzer Prize
        in Literature. The main conflict in the novel is between a mother who <bg>places</bg> a high value
        on hard work and honor and a son who repudiates his mother's values, instead preferring
        the easier path to fortune and celebrity. Like many of Ferber's novels, this novel features
        a tenacious female protagonist with strong character who struggles to deal with ethical
        dilemmas about the importance of status and money.
        <br/>
            Probably the best known of Ferber's novels was <i>Show Boat</i> (1926), which tells the
        story of a Southern woman married to a charismatic but irresponsible man who leaves her
        with a daughter she must take great pains to support. In 1927, the novel was made into a
        musical that has endured to the present.
        <br/>
            Other well-known novels by Ferber include <i>Cimarron</i> (1930) and <i>Giant</i> (1952), both of
        which were made into movies. These were epic novels about the settlement and growth
        of the West, centering on strong female lead characters who marry men lacking the same
        strength of character.
