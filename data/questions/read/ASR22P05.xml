            <b>Limestone Caves</b>
        </div>
        <br/>
            Limestone caves can be spectacular structures filled with giant stalactites and
        stalagmites. These caves are formed when rainwater, which is a weak acid, dissolves
        calcite, or lime, out of limestone. Over time, the lime-laden water drips down into cracks,
        enlarging them into caves. Some of the lime is then redeposited to form stalactites and
        stalagmites.
        <br/>
            Stalactites, which grow down from cave ceilings, are formed in limestone caves when
        groundwater containing dissolved lime drips from the roof of the cave and leaves a thin
        deposit as it evaporates. Stalactites generally grow only a fraction of an inch each year, but
        over time a considerable number may grow to be several yards long. In cases where the
        supply of water is seasonal, they may actually have growth rings resembling those on tree
        trunks that indicate how old the stalactites are.
        <br/>
            Stalagmites are formed on the floor of a limestone cave where water containing
        dissolved lime has dripped either from the cave ceiling or from a stalactite above. They
        develop in the same way as stalactites, when water containing dissolved limestone
        evaporates. In some limestone caves with mature limestone development, stalactites and
        stalagmites grow together, creating limestone pillars that stretch from the cave floor to the
        cave ceiling.
