            Many types of animals combine the advantages of family association with those
        conferred by membership in still larger groups. Bees congregate in hives; some fish move
        in schools; ants gather in mounds; wolves live in packs; deer associate in herds. The main
        advantage of membership in a mass community is the safety that it provides. A large group
        of prey may beÂ· easier for a predator to find at any given point than is a small one, and
        a predator may think twice before taking on such a group; if a predator does decide to
        challenge a large group, <bg>it</bg> may merely encounter a confusing mass of moving bodies and
        possibly may not succeed in its primary goal.
