            This section measures your ability to understand conversations and lectures in English.<br><br>
            The Listening section is divided into separately timed parts. In each part you will listen to 1 conversation and 2 lectures. You will hear each conversation and lecture <b>one</b> time.<br><br>
            After each conversation or lecture, you will answer some questions about it. The questions typically ask about the main idea and supporting details. Some questions ask about a speaker's purpose or attitude. Answer the questions based on what is stated or implied by the speakers.<br><br>
            You may take notes while you listen. You may use your notes to help you answer the questions. Your notes will <b>not</b> be scored.<br><br>
            If you need to change the volume while you listen, click on the <b>Volume</b> icon at the top of the screen.<br><br>
            In some questions, you will see this icon:<img src='$IMAGE/replay.gif'> This means that you will hear, but not see, part of the question.<br><br>
            You must answer each question. After you answer, click on <b>Next</b>. Then click <b>OK</b> to confirm your answer and go on to the next question. After you click on <b>OK</b>, you cannot return to previous questions.<br><br>
            A clock at the top of the screen will show you how much time is remaining. The clock will count down only while you are answering questions.<br><br>
            You will now begin this part of the Listening section.
