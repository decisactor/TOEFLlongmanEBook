            This section measures your ability to understand an academic passage in English.<br><br>
            The Reading section is divided into separately timed parts.  A clock at the top will show you how much time is remaining.<br><br>
            Most questions are worth 1 point, but the last question is worth more than 1 point. The directions for the last question indicate how many points you may receive.<br><br>
            Some passages include a word or phrase that is <font color=blue><u>underlined in blue</u></font>. Click on the word or phrase to see a definition or an explanation.<br><br>
            You can move to the next question by clicking on <b>Next</b>. You can skip questions and go back to them later as long as there is time remaining in the part you are working on. If you want to return to previous questions, click on <b>Back</b>.<br><br>
            You can click on <b>Review</b> at any time and the review screen will show you which questions you have answered and which you have not answered. From this review screen, you may go directly to any question you have already seen within the part of the reading section you are working on.<br><br>
            You will now begin the Reading section. You will read 1 passage. You will have <b>20 minutes</b> to read the passage and answer the questions.<br><br>
            Click on <b>Continue</b> to go on.
