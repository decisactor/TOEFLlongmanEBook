            For this task, you will read a passage about an academic topic. You will have <b>3 minutes</b> to read the passage. You may take notes on the passage while you read. The passage will then be removed and you will listen to a lecture about the same topic. While you listen, you may also take notes.<br><br>
            Then you will write a response to a question that asks you about the relationship between the lecture you heard and the reading passage. Try to answer the question as completely as possible using information from the reading passage and the lecture. The question does <b>not</b> ask you to express your personal opinion. You will be able to see the reading passage again when it is time for you to write. You may use your notes to help you answer the question. You will have <b>20 minutes</b> to write your response.<br><br>
            Typically, an effective response will be 150 to 225 words. You need to demonstrate your ability to write well and to provide complete and accurate content. If you finish your response before time is up, you may click on <b>Next</b> to end this section.<br><br>
            Now you will see the reading passage. Remember it will be available to you again when you write your response. Immediately after the reading time ends, the lecture begins, so keep your headset on until the lecture is over.
